Liver cirrhosis , also known as hepatic cirrhosis , was the cause of death of 6.8 per 100,000 males in Australia in 2010 . Although the death rate from this condition had decreased for the male population over the preceding ten years , the rate was still almost 2.5 times greater in men than in women across the country . While there are many known causes of this disease , it typically develops as a result of chronic liver inflammation . In Australia , common causes of liver disease include hepatitis C , excessive alcohol consumption and obesity . Alcohol consumption and liver health While a large share of the male and female population consume alcohol , many believe that excessive drinking and alcohol abuse is a problem in the country . In fact , almost 60 percent of Australians were concerned about alcohol related health problems . The problems associated with excessive drinking vary from region to region . Recent research has shown that alcohol consumption in regional and remote areas of the country is significantly higher than in metropolitan areas . Unsurprisingly , the Northern Territory had the highest rate of alcohol-induced deaths in the country in 2017 â€“ over four times the rate in Victoria .
