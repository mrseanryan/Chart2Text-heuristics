Petrol vehicles were the most sold car type in the United Kingdom in 2019 . Until 2016 , the share of petrol and diesel engines in new passenger cars was similar , however from 2017 onwards the popularity of diesel cars declined . The decline could be attributable to a number of factors , from the negative perceptions of diesel associated with the â€˜ Dieselgate ' scandal , to fears of a tightening regulatory environment . As of 2017 , the UK ranked below the diesel sales share average in the European Union . Diesel car sales volume below 1 million In terms of sales volume , the number of newly registered passenger cars with a diesel motor fell below one million for the first time in 2018 , amounting to 750,165 units and further declining to 615,705 units as of 2019 . Overall , sales figures were lower than in the previous year . Prices for diesel fuel increasing In the same time period that purchases of diesel passenger cars declined , the average price of diesel fuel steadily increased . A peak in prices was recorded in October 2018 , when it reached 136.7 pence per liter .
