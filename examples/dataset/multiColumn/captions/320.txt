Potential future costs , such as future medical care for soldiers and veterans wounded in the war , are not included . These figures also do not include interest payments on the national debt that will result from higher deficits due to war spending . The war in Afghanistan and Iraq The war in Afghanistan is an ongoing conflict that was initiated when the United States launched Operation Enduring Freedom in October 7 , 2001 , in order to remove the Taliban regime from power and to dismantle the Islamic terrorist organization Al-Qaeda . The war was a direct consequence of the terrorist attacks that occurred in the United States on September 11 , 2001 . The United States and its allies quickly captured major cities and towns in the country and drove the Taliban from power . In December 2001 , the International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) was established by the United Nations Security Council , to oversee security in Afghanistan . In 2003 the NATO assumed leadership of ISAF troops . ISAF forces include troops from 43 different countries . After the killing of Osama bin Laden by U.S. forces , NATO-member countries endorsed an exit strategy for the withdrawal of soldiers from Afghanistan . Up to today , the Afghan war has resulted in more than 10,000 casualties . The Iraq War was an armed conflict between forces from several countries , led by the United States ( named `` coalition of the willing '' ) , and the Iraqi government . The conflict was initiated on March 20 , 2003 , when international forces invaded Iraq and officially ended when in December 18 , 2011 the U.S. completed its withdrawal of military personnel . The intention of the invasion was to overthrow the existing regime of the Ba'ath party under President Saddam Hussein , establishing democratic elections and forming a new government . The invading forces succeeded , destroying Saddam Hussein 's regime on April 9 , 2003 . The subsequent emergence of insurgent militancy and display of opposition to invading forces and the newly formed government still continues and causes many fatalities .
