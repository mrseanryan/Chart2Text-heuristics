This survey , conducted across the United States in January 2014 , shows the extent to which Americans believe in 12 common superstitions . 88 percent of the respondents stated they did not believe that 13 is an unlucky number . Belief in superstitions and religious faith While light-hearted superstitions bringing good or bad luck are alive and well , the majority of Americans do not believe in them . The most-believed superstition is that finding a penny brings good luck ; approximately one third of Americans believe in this . The second most-believed superstition is that seeing the groom before a wedding is bad luck ; close to a quarter of the Americans agreed . In contrast , only seven percent of Americans believe that stepping on a crack is bad luck . Results of the same survey analyzed by religious affiliation show that Catholics tend to believe in such superstitions at higher rates than both Protestants and atheists or agnostics . Therefore it is likely that the more religious you are , the more likely you are to believe in the common cultural superstitions . Looking at a broader poll , which includes differing superstitions/religious beliefs , indicates that almost three quarters of Americans believe in God - an overwhelming majority . Other religious beliefs such as in miracles , heaven , angels , and the devil , were also at the top of this list of things people believe in . The results of the same survey show witches , astrology and reincarnation at the bottom of the list . Interestingly , less people believe in the concept of Heaven than do in the concept of Hell . However , more people believe in them than they do in superstitions , such as seeing the groom before the wedding .
