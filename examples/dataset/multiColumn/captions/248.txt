Following a dramatic increase in 2015 , the EBIT margin of commercial airlines has been falling , with the combined margin for all global airlines projected to be 5.5 percent in 2020 . This is down from 5.7 percent in 2018 , and 8.6 percent in 2015 . EBIT margin EBIT stands for earnings before interest and taxes and is a measure of a company 's profitability . As the name suggests , it includes the income received by a company , less all expenses apart from tax and interest ( either paid or received ) . The EBIT margin is then calculated by dividing the company 's EBIT by the company 's total revenue . Note that amortization and depreciation are included in the expenses deducted for the EBIT calculation , with the acronym EBITDA being used when these are also excluded . EBIT is an appropriate measure for comparing global airlines as it factors out regional differences such as local interest and tax rates . Reasons for the declining EBIT margin Globally , the EBIT ratio for commercial airlines has decreased at time when both industry revenue and passenger demandhave been increasing . One reason for this divergence is fuel costs , with the aforementioned 2015 increase to EBIT margins coinciding with a sharp fall in aviation fuel prices . Another reason may be the increasing market share of low cost carriers , placing downward pressure on ticket prices .
