In 2019 the leader satisfaction scores for the heads of the two main political parties , Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn , plummeted to their lowest scores since November 2016 , at negative 44 for Corbyn and negative 48 for Theresa May . May 's highest satisfaction score was recorded in February 2017 when she had a satisfaction score of 19 percent , while Corbyn 's highest score was one percent in August 2017 . Although Boris Johnson taking over from May in Summer 2019 prompted an increase in the net satisfaction score for the Prime Minister , the score was still a negative one . The Brexit shake-up The result of the Brexit referendum of 2016 where the UK voted to leave the European Union shook up British politics , causing the resignation of the Prime Minster , David Cameron and leading directly to the 2017 General Election . In that election the two largest parties , Labour and Conservative maintained their lead over the smaller parties . This all changed in the first few months of 2019 when support for both main parties declined at an alarming rate . May 's Brexit Deal The sudden decline in support for both main parties seen in early 2019 was undoubtedly caused by the instability of the final months of the May premiership , where she failed to get her Brexit deal through the UK house of Commons three times . As a result May delayed the date of Brexit by seven months , causing a hemorrhaging of support from supporters of Brexit .
