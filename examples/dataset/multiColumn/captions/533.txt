The services sector is the largest in Germany and has been generating a steady share of around 60 percent of gross domestic product since 2007 . Following the financial crisis , the services sector grew to just over 64 percent in 2009 , but otherwise has made up a consistent share of GDP . Industry was hit the hardest in 2009 , dropping just below a quarter of total GDP , while agriculture has been below one percent since the early 2000s . Fewer jobs for agricultural workers From 1991 to 1995 , following the German Unification , the number of employees in agriculture , forestry , and fishery fell by over 300 thousand workers . Since then , it has declined more gradually , decreasing by about 250 thousand workers over more than two decades . Currently , less than two percent of workers are officially employed in the agricultural sector in Germany . Service economies in developed nations A large service sector is a common feature of advanced economies , generating around 70 percent of gross domestic product in the United Kingdom , France , the United States , and Japan , respectively . These nations also have something else in common : a very small agricultural sector . Among them , Japan has the largest industry sector , comparable to Germany 's in fact , at roughly a third of generated GDP .
