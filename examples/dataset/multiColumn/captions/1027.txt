In 2017 , the average biking distance per person per day amounted to approximately 2.5 and 2.3 kilometers for men and women respectively . In terms of the average biking distance by age , children between 12 to 18 years old cycled 5.6 kilometers , the longest distance in 2017 . Furthermore , people aged 25 to 35 years had the lowest average kilometers with roughly two thousand meters a day . Increasing demand for electric bicycles Examining the distance cycled , it decreased from 2015 onwards . A similar trend can be seen with the sales volume of new bicycles . If in 2007 the sales volume amounted to 1.4 million bicycles , in 2017 it decreased to roughly 960,000 bikes . Although overall sales declined , the demand for electric bikes grew . In 2017 , roughly 30 percent of all newly sold bicycles were electric , a growth of nearly 25 percentage points in ten years . 42 percent were city bikes but compared to 2007 , it is a decrease of roughly 20 percent . Nevertheless , these types of bicycles remain having the highest share of the total new bicycle sales in the Netherlands in 2017 . Turnover increase in bicycle retail Despite the decline in sales volume of new bicycles , the total turnover of bicycle retail saw an increase between 2015 and 2017 . In 2015 , the turnover amounted to roughly 1.2 billion euros , whereas in 2017 more than 1.25 billion euros was generated by the bicycle retail industry .
