This statistic depicts the global production of yttrium from 2010 to 2013 , by country . In 2013 , China 's yttrium mine production amounted to approximately 7,000 metric tons of yttrium-oxide . Yttrium Yttrium belongs to the group of transition metals , as well as to the so called rare earth elements . The latter is because of its similarities to the group of lanthanides , with which it is often found together naturally . This chemical element got its name from a mine near Ytterby , Sweden , where it was found for the first time in 1787 by the chemist Carl A. Arrhenius . Like many other rare earth elements , yttrium is frequently used for metallurgical and magnetic purposes . Furthermore , yttrium oxides and sulfides , for example , find their way into screens and radars . The world 's largest yttrium producer is China , which also produces nearly 90 percent of total global rare earth production . In 2013 , China mined almost 99 percent of all yttrium production worldwide . Other countries with smaller yttrium mine production figures include India , Brazil and Malaysia . China also holds the largest deposits of yttrium on Earth . As of 2013 , these reserves were estimated to be some 220 thousand metric tons . The United States has yttrium reserves of an estimated 120 thousand metric tons , making it the holder of the second largest deposit worldwide . Australia , India , Malaysia , Brazil and Sri Lanka are other countries with substantial yttrium holdings .
