Between 2011 and 2016 , the sales of smartphones in France have continuously been increasing , from about 11.5 million units to almost 22 million in 2018 . On the other hand , the sales of laptops have been stagnating since 2012 , while tablet sales peaked at 6.2 million units in 2014 . Moreover , we can see that wearables have appeared on the French market for mobile devices since 2014 : these body-borne devices are small computing devices which extend the performances of computing technologies . Digital devices usage in France In average , half of French people stated spending from two to four hours on their mobile devices ( smartphone , tablet or computer ) in a survey from 2019 . Furthermore , the share of people using their smartphone to conduct various activities such as online purchases has increased in the past years , reaching almost 30 percent by 2018 . However , a high proportion of French people also seem to consider themselves as addicted to their devices , especially young adults aged 18 to 34 years old . Connected wearables usage in France Nevertheless , about a fifth of interviewed in 2017 intended to buy a connected device in the future : 19 percent mentioned a connected bracelet or watch to track and display physical activity . This example of wearable usage appears to broaden across French society , since about the same proportion of respondents ( 20 percent ) stated in 2019 using devices allowing them to monitor their heart rate or perspiration when doing sports .
