Virtual reality - additional information A 2015 Statista survey conducted in the United States has asked the question `` Have you ever heard of the term 'virtual reality ' _ ?

VR can help replicate an environment , whether real or completely imaginary by stimulating all senses : sight and hearing , as well as sometimes touch , smell , or even taste .

As of 2015 , a number of companies are announcing commercially available HMDs specifically created for VR . These include the Oculus Rift ( produced by a Facebook-acquired company â€“ Oculus VR ) , the HTC Vive ( HTC in partnership with Valve Corporation ) or Project Morpheus ( Sony 's VR headset for the Playstation 4 ) . According to recent forecasts , revenue from virtual reality Head-mounted displays is expected to grow from 685 million U.S. dollars in 2015 to 3.89 billion U.S. dollars in 2018 . Other hardware includes data gloves - gloves with attached sensors detecting hand movements , which allow the user to interact with the virtual world and to `` touch '' objects inside it , as well as wands or even treadmills . It is estimated that , by 2018 , over 100 million units of various such input systems will be sold , producing revenues of over 760 million U.S. dollars . The VR industry is growing at a fast pace , with revenues from virtual reality products ( both hardware and software ) projected to increase from 90 million U.S. dollars in 2014 to 5.2 billion U.S. dollars in 2018 . The number of active VR users is forecast to reach 171 million by 2018 .
