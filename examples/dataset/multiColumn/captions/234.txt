Volkswagen Group 's top brand is its namesake Volkswagen passenger car brand , which saw sales drop by some 868,000 units between 2014 and 2018 , to reach 3.7 million units in 2018 . Despite the sales slump , it still accounted for almost half of motor vehicles sold by the automaker outside China and about one third of all vehicles sold by Volkswagen Group in 2018 . Other brands have noticeably increased in sales , such as Skoda , Seat , and Porsche . All three brands in the commercial vehicle segments also show a general upward trend . Lost faith due to scandal Falling sales levels are in part due to a loss in consumer confidence following the 2015 diesel emissions scandal , which led to a significant operating loss of around four billion euros in 2015 . The automotive will have to pay about 96.5 million U.S. dollars to motorists in the United States after equipping at least 10.8 million diesel vehicles worldwide with a device that lowers the production of greenhouse gas emissions during fuel economy tests . The luxurious market shift Many motorists prioritize comfort and enjoyment when driving , and the increasing market size of luxury cars shows how consumers are willing to spend more on upmarket vehicles . Typically speaking , European brands dominate the luxury car market with the top three luxury brands all being German , including Volkswagen owned Audi . Even in the United States , where European brands struggle in other segments , European luxury cars tend to do well . Over a third of models on the future U.S. sports and luxury car market are expected to be European . As consumers ' preferences shift towards electric vehicles and luxury cars , Volkswagen will compete with companies such as Tesla or Byton to produce high-performance vehicles .
