AG Insurance was the largest active company on the Belgian insurance market , reaching a market share of more than 20 percent in 2018 . AXA and KBC reached market share of 12 percent and 9.3 percent respectively . When it comes to health insurance , however , the market shares change . ERGO was the concern with the highest market share in Belgium 's private health insurance market in this period . What is the insurance market size in Belgium ? In 2018 , there were 111 insurance companies in Belgium . The biggest insurance branch in Belgium is the `` life '' branch , which focuses on life insurances , pensions and funeral in kind insurances . This is based on the so-called life insurance market share in terms of gross premium , a ratio which measures whether consumers spend more on life insurance or on non-life insurance . This ratio was approximately 76 percent in Belgium in 2005 . This , however , decreased to approximately 54 percent in 2017 . How does health insurance work in Belgium ? In Belgium , all employees and self-employed must register and make contributions to one of five free health insurance funds or `` mutualities '' ( in Dutch : mutualiteit or ziekenfonds , in French : mutuelle ) . These funds are paid by social benefits and government subsidies , with patients free to choose their own medical professionals and places of treatment . To increase the cover for medical costs , however , Belgian residents can add private supplementary health insurances to their mutuality . For these reasons , Belgium writes less direct premiums for health insurance than the Netherlands ( where the contents of basic health insurance are decided by the government but provided and partially funded by private health insurance companies ) .
