This statistic shows global e-book revenue from 2009 to 2011 , and a forecast thereof to 2016 , broken down by region . In 2010 , e-book revenue in North America amounted to 1.2 billion U.S. dollars and was forecast to grow to almost 11 billion U.S. dollars by 2016 . The revenue from trade e-book sales stood at 1.1 billion U.S. dollars in 2011 and grew to 1.4 billion U.S. dollars in 2015 . E-books - additional information Electronic books have been around for over twenty years , but it was not until the recent mobile revolution that the medium 's revenues began to reflect its potential . The North American market , boosted by surge of interest from consumers in the United States , is one of the fastest-growing e-book markets in the world , but growth in Western Europe and the Asia Pacific region is predicted to increase . Between 2008 and 2012 , the unit sales per year increased by over 400 million units , and by 2018 , the e-book share of total book sales is expected to grow to over 25 percent , more than doubling its share from 2013 . Whereas electronic book consumption and revenue is expected to grow , almost all print book categories are expected to decrease . Consumers are still refraining from completely embracing the e-reader and e-book trend . A survey of U.S. readers in 2015 revealed that 47 percent only read hard copy books , while only four percent only read e-books . Unsurprisingly , younger people are more likely to be e-book readers , especially as many of the newer e-reading devices are also tablet computers or smartphones , giving consumers even more reason to have these devices around on a more regular basis .
