This statistic depicts the age distribution in the United States from 2008 to 2018 . In 2018 , about 18.71 percent of the U.S. population fell into the 0 - 14 year category , 65.48 percent into the 15 - 64 age group and 15.81 percent of the population were over 65 years of age . The increasing population of the United States The United States of America is one of the most populated countries in the world , trailing just behind China and India . A total population count of around 320 million inhabitants and a more-or-less steady population growth over the past decade indicate that the country has steadily improved its living conditions and standards for the population . Leading healthier lifestyles and improved living conditions have resulted in a steady increase of the life expectancy at birth in the United States . Life expectancies of men and women at birth in the United States were at a record high in 2012 . Furthermore , a constant fertility rate in recent years and a decrease in the death rate and infant mortality , all due to the improved standard of living and health care conditions , have helped not only the American population to increase but as a result , the share of the population younger than 15 and older than 65 years has also increased in recent years , as can be seen above .
