In 2019 , 5.77 percent of the workforce in Russia was employed in agriculture , 26.93 percent in industry and 67.3 percent in services . Russia 's economy The majority of Russia 's labor force works in the services sector , which accounts for more than half of the jobs in the country . About 30 percent work in the industry sector and the rest in agriculture . Interestingly , Russia is among the leading export countries worldwide and agricultural products , as well as meat , are among the main exported goods . Russia 's economy also profits significantly from selling and exporting fish and sea food . Due to large oil resources , Russia is also among the largest economies and the countries with the largest gross domestic product / GDP worldwide . Subsequently , living and working conditions in Russia should be above average , but for a long time , many Russians have struggled to get by . While conditions seem to improve nowadays , many Russians still live below the poverty line . One suggested reason for this is corruption , which has been cited as a severe problem for the country for a long time , and continues to pose difficulties for Russia 's economy . Illicit employment and the so-called `` shadow economy '' , which does not officially contribute to the fiscal system , yields amounts worth almost half of Russia 's gross domestic product . This can be seen on a ranking of the untaxed economy in selected countries as a share of GDP . In addition to oil , fish and agricultural products , Russia also manufactures and exports arms and weapons . It is ranked third among the countries with the highest military spending , and second among the countries , in which military spending accounts for a significant percentage of the gross domestic product .
