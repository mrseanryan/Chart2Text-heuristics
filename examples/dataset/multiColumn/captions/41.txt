It is usually seen as a driving force in economic growth , accompanied by industrialization , modernization and the spread of education . Urbanization levels tend to be higher in industrial countries , whereas the degree of urbanization in developing countries remains relatively low . According to World Bank , a mere 19.6 percent of the Chinese population had been living in urban areas in 1980 . Since then , China 's urban population has skyrocketed . By 2018 , nearly 60 percent of the Chinese population lived in urban areas . Regional urbanization rates In the last decades , urbanization has progressed greatly in every region of China . Even in the more remote Chinese provinces , the urbanization rate reached nearly 50 percent in recent years or went beyond . However , the most urbanized areas are still to be found in the coastal eastern and southern regions of China . The population of Shanghai , the largest city in China and the world 's seventh largest city is projected to reach 30 million people by 2025 . China 's urban areas are characterized by a developing middle class . Per capita disposable income of Chinese urban households has more than doubled between 2008 and 2018 . The emerging middle class is expected to become a significant driver for the continuing growth of the Chinese economy .
