In 2018 , agriculture contributed around 22.85 percent to the GDP of Pakistan , 17.99 percent came from the industry , and over half of the economy 's contribution to GDP came from the services sector . When shall we three contribute again ? There are three main sectors of economy : The primary sector encompassed agriculture , fishing and mining . The secondary sector is the manufacturing sector , also known as the industry sector ; and last but not least , the tertiary sector , alias the services sector , which includes services and intangible goods , like tourism , financial services , or telecommunications . Today , most developed countries have a well-established services sector that contributes the lion 's share to their GDP . On the other hand , economies that still need support and are still developing typically rely on agriculture to fuel their economy . If they transition to a developed nation , it is usually because their economy is now able to focus on services as an economic driver . Pakistan 's economic driver To be fair , almost every economy started out relying on the primary sector . The same is true for Pakistan , which , although it is not considered a developed nation yet , has shifted generation of over half of its annual GDP to services . Still , the primary sector plays an important role for the country : It is still responsible for more than a fifth of GDP contribution , and it employs almost half of Pakistan 's workforce . Pakistan is rich in arable land , which explains why the majority of the Pakistani population lives in rural areas , producing and selling sugarcane , wheat , cotton , and rice , which are also exported to other countries .
