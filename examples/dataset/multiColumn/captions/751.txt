The cost of fossil fuels in the electric power industry can vary depending on the source that is used . In general , fossil fuels cost about 2.83 U.S. dollars per million British thermal units ( Btu ) but can range from 2.06 U.S. dollars per million Btu for coal to 9.68 U.S. dollars per million Btu for petroleum . Coal and oil prices In general , coal and oil prices have been the most volatile , while natural gas prices have remained relatively stable in comparison . The price of Brent Crude oil is expected to reach 67 U.S. dollars per barrel in 2020 . Oil blends tend to hover around similar spot prices while different coal deposit types can heavily impact the energy density carried by the coal , and thus , prices . Natural gas price Similar to coal , natural gas prices can vary based on the source . Natural gas prices have experienced a decline over the last decade or so , reaching about 3.55 U.S. dollars per million Btu in 2018 from 8.21 U.S. dollars in 2005 . This drop in U.S. prices are likely related to more accessible and economic shale gas supplies . In natural gas markets in Asia , most natural gas is sourced as liquid natural gas ( LNG ) and is compressed which is easier to transport , however , the liquefaction process ends up as a sunk cost and increases the overall price .
