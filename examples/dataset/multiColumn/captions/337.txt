The number of commercial air carriers in the United States has been steadily decreasing , with the number of major carriers falling from 22 in 2008 to 18 in 2019 . For smaller air carriers the decline has been even stronger , with the 66 carriers counted in 2008 shrinking to 41 by 2018 . Major air carriers According to the U.S. Bureau of Transportation , major air carriers are commercial airlines generating over one billion U.S. dollars in operating revenue per year . The number of major air carriers can therefore change through smaller airlines growing , as well as through new carriers being created , or existing carriers exiting the market ( including through mergers , notably the merger between US Airways and American Airlines in October 2015 ) . This threshold is set such that the majority of the U.S. market is serviced by carriers designated as major , with the top 10 carriers alone accounting for over 90 percent of the domestic market . Air travel in the United States The decline in the number of U.S. airlines in no way is a sign of a decline in the U.S. air travel market â€“ rather , the opposite is true . Total passenger miles flown by U.S. carriers have increased strongly over this period , with all of the leading carriers seeing year-on-year increases in their passenger numbers . However , these statistics hide a decline in regional air travel in the U.S . Since 2010 , fewer passengers have been making less and less trips on regional carriers each year .
