In 2018 , agriculture contributed around 2.46 percent to the GDP of Australia , 24.12 percent came from industry , and 66.56 percent from the services sector . The same year , the Australian inflation rate , another important key indicator for its economic situation , amounted to 1.96 percent . Why is the inflation rate important ? Inflation is the steady increase in price levels for consumer goods and services during a certain timespan . The European Central Bank considers a steady inflation rate of two percent a year beneficial for a stable economy â€“ otherwise a country risks economic hardship . In the worst case , a country can experience either hyperinflation ( like Venezuela ) , which is the rapid increase of prices to a point of economic collapse , or deflation , which is the decrease of prices and devaluation of money that can also lead to economic collapse . Up and down under Australia 's inflation has been clawing itself out of a slump in 2016 , when it unceremoniously dropped to 1.25 percent due to falling petrol costs and oil prices . The following year , it recovered instantaneously and soared back to just under two percent , and forecasts see it reaching 2.52 percent by 2021 . Australians do n't seem too worried about this outlier , and rightly so , since Australia 's economy is still one of the biggest in the Asia-Pacific region and worldwide .
