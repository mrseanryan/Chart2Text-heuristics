The volume of coal produced from deep mining has fallen considerably since 1970 . In that year , 136.6 million metric tons was produced , but by 2018 this had fallen to just 7,390 metric tons . Production volumes since 2015 have been higher from surface mining than deep mining . Death of an industry As production has decreased , so have the number of mines . In 2000 , deep mine numbers stood at 33 , but in less than 20 years this number had fallen to just 3 . This in turn has affected employment numbers . Historically the coal industry has been a major powerhouse of the UK 's economy , employing more than one million individuals in 1920 . By 2017 the number of employees was just 1,000 , showing a shift away from the fossil fuel . Coal in the energy mix The reliance on coal in the UK 's energy mix has plummeted since 2012 , and in 2017 its share was just 6.7 percent . This has coincided with the increase in renewable electricity generation , which overtook coal for the first time in 2015 . In May 2019 , Britain went one week without coal power , the first time this had happened since 1882 .
