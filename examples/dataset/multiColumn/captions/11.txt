In an impressive increase from years past , 35.3 percent of women in the United States had completed four years or more of college in 2018 . This figure is up from 3.8 percent of women in 1940 . A significant increase can also be seen in males , with 34.6 percent of the U.S. male population having completed four years or more of college , up from 5.5 percent in 1940 . 4- and 2-year colleges In the United States , college students are able to choose between attending a 2-year postsecondary program and a 4-year postsecondary program . Generally , attending a 2-year program results in an Associate 's Degree , and 4-year programs result in a Bachelor 's Degree . Many 2-year programs are designed so that attendees can transfer to a college or university offering a 4-year program upon completing their Associate 's . Completion of a 4-year program is the generally accepted standard for entry-level positions when looking for a job . Earnings after college Factors such as gender , degree achieved , and the level of postsecondary education can have an impact on employment and earnings later in life . Some Bachelor 's Degrees continue to attract more male students than female , particularly in STEM fields , while liberal arts degrees such as education , languages and literatures , and communication tend to see higher female attendance . All of these factors have an impact on earnings after college , and despite nearly the same rate of attendance within the American population between males and females , men with a Bachelor 's Degree continue to have higher weekly earnings on average than their female counterparts .
