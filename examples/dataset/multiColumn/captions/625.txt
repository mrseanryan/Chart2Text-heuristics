Ridesharing platform , Uber has been increasing the gender diversity of its workforce , which was 59.1 percent male and 40.9 percent female as of March 2019 . Ridesharing company employees The above figures only refer to staff that are employed directly by Uber , and do not include drivers . Controversially , Uber take the view that their drivers are independent contractors , rather than company employees . The same is true for their main competitor in the U.S. market - Lyft . This means that drivers need to pay for all operating costs out of their earnings , such vehicle maintenance and insurance . Given that earnings for ridesharing drivers are generally between 15 and 20 U.S. dollars an hour , after expenses this can mean that drivers ' earnings are far below the minimum wage . Diversity in the ridesharing industry The gender diversity of Uber 's employees is similar to that of Lyft , whose workforce is 60 percent male and 40 percent female . Lyft has a higher portion of women in leadership roles though â€“ 32.8 percent compared to Uber 's 28 percent . In terms of ethnic diversity , Uber 's workforce is more diverse than that of Lyft .
