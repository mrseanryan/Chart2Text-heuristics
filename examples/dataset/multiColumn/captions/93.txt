In 2018 , agriculture contributed around 0.63 percent to the United Kingdom 's GDP , 17.51 percent came from the manufacturing industry , and 71.04 percent from the services sector . The UK is not a farmer 's market The vast majority of the UK 's GDP is generated by the services sector , and tourism in particular keeps the economy going . In 2017 , almost 214 billion British Pounds were contributed to the GDP through travel and tourism – about 277 billion U.S. dollars – and the forecasts see an upwards trend . For comparison , only an estimated 10.3 billion GBP were generated by the agriculture sector in the same year . But is it a tourist 's destination still ? Though forecasts are not in yet , it is unclear whether travel and tourism can keep the UK 's economy afloat in the future , especially after Brexit and all its consequences . Higher travel costs , having to wait for visas , and overall more complicated travel arrangements are just some of the concerns tourists have when considering vacationing in the UK after Brexit . Consequences of the referendum are already observable in the domestic travel industry : In 2017 , about 37 percent of British travelers said Brexit caused them to cut their holidays short by a few days , and about 14 percent said they did not leave the UK for their holidays because of it .
