In 2019 , Sony is expected to remain the top position in the virtual reality ( VR ) device market , accounting for around 37 percent of total shipments . The other major players in the VR device market are primarily large tech companies like Oculus ( Facebook ) , HTC , and Microsoft , each of which account for a relatively significant portion of the total market share , but still lag far behind Sony in terms of total unit shipments . The Virtual Reality Market Alongside the hardware sector , which focuses on the manufacture and sale of VR devices , the industry also contains a growing software market that has evolved into a billion-dollar business in recent years . Developers from a wide range of industries are seeing the possibilities of VR and are eager to incorporate the technology into their businesses . Gaming companies seek to use VR for further immersion , while healthcare and engineering firms seek to use VR for training and modelling . Virtual Reality Users Although the technology is slowly becoming more popular , VR usage options are still somewhat limited and have not achieved the same levels of widespread use that some other consumer electronics devices have . Despite this , a significant portion of U.S.-based young adults state that they intend to purchase some sort of virtual or augmented reality device , and total worldwide mobile VR users are expected to exceed one hundred million in the near future .
