Between 2011 and 2017 , road traffic injuries in the United States grew by about 530,000 incidents to some 2.7 million road traffic-related injuries in 2017 . Over the same period , fatalities had also increased by about 5,000 . This follows two decades of a general decrease in the amount of traffic-related injuries . Why are traffic injuries increasing ? In the United States , male drivers are behind the wheel in the majority of fatal crashes . Speeding and driving under the influence of alcohol have often been to blame , neither have led to a rise in traffic fatalities in the U.S . Instead , cellphones are primarily the cause . Smartphone ownership has become almost omnipresent in the U.S. since 2011 , and drivers are likely to be distracted by texting and using social media . Young drivers are the ones accounting for the highest share of cellphone use fatalities . Another reason why fatal accidents are rising in number is that non-occupants ' exposure to risk is also increasing . As residents become more encouraged to walk or cycle in cities , the extra time amongst traffic has led to higher rates of fatalities and injuries amongst cyclists and pedestrians . Lastly , poor infrastructure and lack of awareness by motorists is prevalent in large parts of the United States .
