The following year imports from the EU dropped to 42,000 metric tons , and by 2017 Russia emerged as the main exporter . Anthracite is the highest ranking of coal . It is often referred to as hard coal and has the highest carbon content and energy density of all types of coal . It also has a higher quality when compared to normal coal . Coal types Whilst the EU was the main provider of anthracite to the UK , the regions exports of coking coal paled in comparison to Australia and the United States . Australia was the main exporter of this form of coal , exporting more than four million metric tons in 2002 . However , imports from Australia began to decrease annually from 2012 , and by 2018 the country was exporting less than Russia . Russia is the leading exporter of steam coal to the UK . From 2013 to 2016 , imports from Russia fell from 19 million metric tons to just 1.6 million . Despite this decline , there was a recovery in the following years with imports rising to 3.8 million metric tons . Coal consumption The consumption of coal for energy use in the United Kingdom has fallen significantly in recent decades . In 1980 , consumption was increased to 120.8 million metric tons of oil equivalent , but by 2018 it had fallen to a low of 8.5 million metric tons of oil equivalent . As of 2018 , coal made up just 7.64 percent of the average UK fuel mix .
