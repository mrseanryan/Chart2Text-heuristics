Between the 1950s and today , the average age to marry in the Netherlands increased significantly for both genders . Whereas in 1950 , men were on average 30 years old when they married and women were nearly 27 years old , in 2018 this was 38.2 and 35.2 years respectively . This raise in the average age at marriage however meant a decrease in the number of marriages per person , which decreased by over 0.10 in the last decade alone . The average Dutch male married 0.57 times in 2018 , whereas the average female married 0.55 times . Number of marriages In 2018 , roughly 64,300 marriages took place . The majority of these marriages were closed between a man and a woman , but since the same-sex marriage was legalized in the Netherlands in 2001 , each year also between 1,200 and 1,500 same-sex couples tie the knot . In the last decade , the number of marriages peaked in 2008 , when over 75,400 marriages took place . Living happily ever after In 2017 , nearly 60,000 couples celebrated 12.5 years of marital bliss , and a further 58,700 couples had been married for 25 years . And of course , with time the number of special wedding anniversaries decreases , as divorce or death dissolves many a marriage . Still , that year 345 couples celebrated 70 years of wedded life together .
