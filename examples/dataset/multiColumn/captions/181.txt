The graph shows the age distribution in China from 2008 to 2018 . In 2018 , approximately 72 percent of the population were between 15 and 64 years of age . Age distribution in China â€“ additional information As can be seen from this statistic , the age pyramid in China has been gradually shifting towards older demographics during the past decade . Mainly due to low birth rates in China , the age group of 0 to 14 year-olds has declined by approximately three percent since 2007 , whereas the age groups 65 years and over have seen growth of about three percent . Thus , the median age of the Chinese population has been constantly rising since 1970 and is forecast to reach 47 years by 2050 . Accompanied by a more or less steady mortality rate of about 7 per thousand , China is showing strong signs of an aging population . The impact of this severe change in demographics is the subject of an ongoing scientific discussion . Rising standards of living in China contain the demand for better health care and pension insurance for retirees , which will be hard to meet with the social insurance system in China still being in its infancy . Per capita expenditure on medical care and services of urban households has more than tripled since 2000 with a clear and distinctive upward trend for the near future . As for social security spending , public pension expenditure is forecast to take up approximately nine percent of China 's GDP by 2050 .
