Its news division focuses on Nassau and Suffolk counties with additional emphases on parts of Long Island , Queens , as well as Rockland and Westchester counties . It was founded by the daughter of the New York Daily News Founder , Alicia Peterson , who received funding from her husband at the time , Harry Guggenheim . It is now a subsidiary of Cablevision which purchased the paper for $ 650 million in 2008 . It has won 19 Pulitzer Prizes over the course of its history and has a reputable history despite its tabloid style formatting . Even with a solid content base , though , the paper has not been an exception to the industry trend of reduced circulation and readership numbers . Fortunately , it has been able to establish a relatively healthy internet presence with the fourth highest circulation of digital newspaper editions , falling behind only the Wall Street Journal , New York Times , and New York Daily News . This online presence will continue to be make-or-break as print newspaper readership numbers continue their steady and expected declines.One area where Newsday has shown positive trends is with its Sunday edition . While it has experienced on-going declines in circulation and readership numbers , by 2012 the number of readers had leveled out and actually grew slightly over the fall of 2011 . Though this is unlikely to begin a new trend , it does provide some hope that in the right publishing markets with adept marketing and content focus , some newspapers may be here to stay .
