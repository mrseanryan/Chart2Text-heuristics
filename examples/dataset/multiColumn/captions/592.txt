In 2018 , the European Union imported 26.8 billion euros worth of clothing from China , the EU 's leading import partner in this category . The EU itself is an important supplier of clothing items to the rest of the world , Italy providing the greatest export value . Altogether , clothing exports from EU countries reached 129 billion euros in 2017 . China : global textile supplier Not surprisingly , the EU 's main source of clothing is also a global force when it comes to supplying textiles . China currently holds a 37 percent share of the world 's textile exports , while the EU itself is responsible for a quarter of textile products shipped to the rest of the world . EU 's textile and clothing businesses In 2018 , the EU 's textile and clothing manufacturers generated the highest revenue in the textile segment at 91.4 billion euros , although turnover from clothing manufacturers did not differ greatly from that either .
