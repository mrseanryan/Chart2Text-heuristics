In the most recently reported fiscal year , Spotify generated just under 6.1 billion euros in premium revenue and 678 million in ad-supported revenue . Both figures were the highest reported to date , with premium revenue having grown by more than two billion euros since 2017 . Contributing to Spotify 's success was its strong global subscriber base â€“ as of the first quarter of 2019 , the music streaming platform had 100 million subscribers worldwide . Spotify has proved popular in multiple markets across the world , namely the United States , where more than 25 percent of 18 to 34-year-olds reported using the service . Spotify 's competition Spotify 's closest competitor is Apple Music . That said , Apple 's worldwide subscribers are almost half that of Spotify 's , despite both services being popular for different reasons . Theoretically , Pandora Radio could have presented Spotify with a fair amount of competition , but this was not to be . Pandora 's radio station format failed to match Spotify 's playlist set-up in terms of popularity , and Pandora struggled to convert its users into paid subscribers , something which Spotify has always been good at . Pandora Radio received heavy investment from Sirius XM in 2017 and was officially acquired by the company in early 2019 , so it will be interesting to see what happens in the future as Sirius gets to work on Pandora 's audience and attempts to generate cash from its arguably wide ( but unpaid ) user base . For now though , it seems that Spotify 's position remains safe .
