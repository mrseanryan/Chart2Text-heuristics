How many airports are in the U.S. ? While the number of public use airports in the United States has fallen since 1990 , the number of private use airports has increased in recent years . In 2018 , there were 5,087 public airports in the U.S. , a slight decrease from the 5,145 public airports operating in 2014 . Conversely , the number of private airports increased over this period from 13,863 to 14,549 . Public use versus private use airports The distinction between public and private use airports refers to usage , not ownership . A public use airport is defined by the FAA as â€˜ an airport available for use by the general public without a requirement for prior approval of the airport owner or operator ' _ , whereas prior approval is required for private use airports . Included here under the term airport are also heliports , seaplane bases , and facilities for other aerial hobbies . Air passenger traffic in the United States The last decade has seen consistent increases in the number of domestic passengers carried by major U.S. airlines , the number of international passengers travelling to and from the U.S. , and the overall number of passenger-miles flown . It may therefore seem strange that the number of public use airports has decreased . This change can likely be explained , at least in part , by the significant decline in the number of regional flights over this period .
