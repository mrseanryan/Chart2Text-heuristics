Ireland was the European country with the largest share of diesel cars . Although figures had decreased since 2013 , diesel cars still made up 65 percent of all new passenger cars bought in Ireland in 2017 . By comparison , Portugal had had the same share of new diesel cars as Ireland in 2013 , but was able to cut said share by eleven percent within the following four years . The overall reduction in diesel car sales is unsurprising given the 2015 diesel scandal and subsequent discussions surrounding health and environmental impacts of the fuel type . Volvo sells most diesel cars The greatest share of new passenger cars fitted with a diesel engine were sold by Volvo . In 2017 , nearly eight out of ten cars sold by the Swedish carmaker in Europe were reliant on diesel fuel . This was despite a nine percent decrease since 2013 . Out of all car makers , Fiat was the only one which recorded positive development , with the percentage of diesel cars sold increasing from 31 percent in 2013 to 36 percent in 2017 . Diesel pollution worse than petrol The diesel scandal uncovered that amounts of the air pollutant nitrogen oxide ( NOx ) released by diesel cars were in fact exorbitantly higher than testing previously suggested . This was due to software installed by carmakers masking actual emission figures . Diesel pollution would cost taxpayers nearly 56 billion euros in health and non-health related expenses . This was more than five times the amount of petrol pollution costs .
