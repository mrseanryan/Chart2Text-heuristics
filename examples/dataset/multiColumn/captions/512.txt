Deloitte reported total revenue figures of around 46.2 billion U.S. dollars in 2019 , the most of the Big Four accounting firms . The company also led the rankings in the Americas , but it was PwC who came out on top in both the Asia Pacific and Europe , the Middle East , and Africa ( EMEA ) regions . Accounting around the world Deloitte generated around 24.2 billion U.S. dollars in North and South America in 2019 , which was more than half of their overall revenue worldwide . A similar story was reported by PwC , with almost half of their aggregated worldwide revenue in 2019 being made in the regions of the Asia Pacific and EMEA . PwC experienced particularly strong growth in EMEA where aggregate revenues in the region in 2019 increased by nearly half a billion U.S. dollars on the previous year . Who are the Big Four ? The four biggest accounting firms worldwide are Deloitte , PricewaterhouseCoopers ( PwC ) , Ernst and Young ( EY ) , and Klynveld Peat Marwick Goerdeler ( KPMG ) . Known as the Big Four , the companies have a significant oligopoly in the accounting market : they collectively generated close to 155 billion U.S. dollars worldwide in 2019 and employed over one million people globally . Until 1989 , the market had been dominated by eight accounting firms – also known as audit firms or professional services networks – but the number has since halved due to mergers and the collapse of major American accounting firm Arthur Andersen .
