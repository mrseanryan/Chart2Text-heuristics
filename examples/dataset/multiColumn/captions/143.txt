In 2017 , the United States was the world 's largest natural gas producer in the world , producing 761.1 billion cubic meters . Russia was the second largest natural gas producer , with its 2017 production amounting to nearly 692 billion cubic meters . Natural gas production The total volume of natural gas produced worldwide amounted to 3.87 trillion cubic meters in 2018 . Although the United States is the world 's largest natural gas producer , it is the fourth largest exporter of natural gas . Accordingly , domestic consumption of natural gas accounts for a large share of U.S. natural gas end use . U.S. shale gas revolution Due to recent advances in hydraulic fracturing ( fracking ) technology and horizontal drilling , shale gas sources in the U.S. have become economically feasible to develop . This has also offset production declines from conventional natural gas sources there . This development has also increased U.S. natural gas reserves considerably . As of 2017 , the U.S. produced a total of nearly 19 trillion cubic feet of shale gas .
