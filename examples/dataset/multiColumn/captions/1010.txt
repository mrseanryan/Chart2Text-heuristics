Heart transplants are required when an individual 's heart has stopped working effectively and brings a risk to the person 's life . A person who has recently died but with a healthy heart may be a suitable donor for a heart transplant . In Europe in 2018 , Slovenia had the highest rate of heart transplants with 11 per million population , followed by Croatia with a rate of 8.8 . Not everyone consents to organ donation As a heart transplant requires a deceased donor , if the deceased person was not explicitly registered as a donor it is at the discretion of the family . In Ireland in 2016 , fifty percent of families refused to consent to their family member 's organs being used after death . This was the highest rate of refusals in Europe between 2015 and 2017 . Slovenia had a family refusal rate of almost sixteen percent in 2017 . Looking for a heart Unfortunately , there are many cases of individuals who do not manage to survive long enough on the transplant list to receive a new heart . In Germany in 2018 , 86 individuals died while waiting for a heart transplant , the highest amount in Europe . This was followed by 79 deaths in Poland and 58 in Italy .
