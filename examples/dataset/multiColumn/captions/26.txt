This statistic displays the number of murder victims in the United States by race/ethnicity and gender in 2018 . In 2018 , 3,180 murder victims were female . Additional information on black/African American murder victims in the United StatesAccording to male deaths by firearm-related injuries by ethnicity , the amount of black victims has fallen by over half since 1970 in proportion to the population . While this improvement has been welcomed , black males remained twice as likely to be the victim of a gun related death compared with white males . This inequality has lead to a rise in political action and demonstration around what is perceived as inaction or ignorance over the issue by government and wider society . The high profile death of Trayvon Martin in Florida followed by the deaths at the hand of police Freddie Gray and Michael Brown served as the catalyst for such movements . The wider issue of violence beyond murder also appears to have systemic correlations . The percentage of violent crime victims with socio-emotional problems by race demonstrates that black Americans experienced socio-emotional issues at a greater rate . Moreover , the issue of a higher exposure to violence for black Americans stretches to the schooling system where 8.4 percent of black children were threatened or injured with a weapon in 2013 .
