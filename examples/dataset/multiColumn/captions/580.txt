In 2018 , the rate of unemployment in Belgium was six percent â€“ the lowest it had been in a decade . There were real regional differences within the country though . The Flemish region did particularly well economically , with an unemployment rate of 3.5 percent in 2018 . By comparison : unemployment was more than twice as high in the Walloon Region , and nearly four times as high in the Brussels-Capital Region . Number of unemployed per region Although Flanders had the lowest unemployment rate of all three regions , the actual number of unemployed people here was highest , at over 126,000 in 2018 . The Brussels-Capital Region , which had the highest unemployment rate , counted only 70,347 unemployed that year . This is mainly a result of a demographic imbalance : the Flemish region has nearly twice as many inhabitants as the Walloon Region , and over five times as many as the Brussels-Capital Region . Unemployment forecasts According to a recent KBC forecast , the unemployment rate in Belgium was expected to decrease even further in 2019 , to just under six percent . The Federal Plan Agency predicted a similar trend , with the number of unemployed people in Belgium falling from nearly 560,000 in 2017 to just under 390,000 in 2023 .
