The decade of the merger The accounting industry experienced a period of significant change during the 1980s , as eight firms sought ways to gain advantages in new international markets . Peat Marwick International ( PMI ) was one member of the Big Eight looking for ways to meet the growing global demand for professional services ; Klynveld Main Goerdeler ( KMG ) was a smaller firm operating outside of the Big Eight and struggling to make an impression . In 1987 , the two firms agreed to a merger that made strategic sense to both and immediately made the newly formed KPMG the largest accounting firm in the world . As competition for international clients intensified , two further mega mergers took place at the end of an extraordinary decade in the accounting industry , as the Big Eight became the Big Six in 1989 .
