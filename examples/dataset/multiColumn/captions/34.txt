This statistic shows the global consumption of vegetable oils from 2013/14 to 2019/20 . In 2018/19 , sunflowerseed oil consumption amounted to 18.07 million metric tons worldwide . Global vegetable oil production amounted to around 203 million metric tons in 2018/19 . Vegetable oils Vegetable oils are oils or fats extracted from a plant . Their texture can be described as liquid , oily and fatty . Most vegetable oils are able to fulfill two functions : they can either be used as cooking oil or for fuel and diesel production . The most common oil types include palm oil , soybean oil , canola oil and sunflowerseed oil . Palm oil is extracted from the flesh of the palm fruit , which is primarily found in the tropical climate of Africa , South America and South East Asia . It is estimated that about 90 percent of palm oil is used for food consumption , whereas industrial consumption such as cosmetic products or fuel and diesel claim the remaining 10 percent . In terms of consumption as a food product , vegetable oils are seen as the healthier alternative as they contain more unsaturated fatty acids than animal fats . One of the most widely used cooking oils is canola oil , also known as rapeseed oil . It is obtained by extraction from the rapeseed , which is first slightly heated and then crushed . Rapeseed oil , in particular , is seen to have the advantages of containing a higher amount of omega-3 ( linolenic acid ) and omega-6 ( linoleic ) fatty acids and to be low in saturated fatty acids .
