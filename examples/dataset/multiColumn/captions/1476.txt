In 2017 , Liander was the operating manager ( DSO or distribution system operator ) with the highest market share in the Dutch electricity market . The Netherlands has a single electricity market , where taxes are imposed on a national basis . The country 's distribution network , however , operates on different regional levels . Liander , for example , operates in the Amsterdam area wheras Stedin is active in cities as Rotterdam and Utrecht and most of the South Holland and Utrecht provinces . Enexis operates in five of the 12 Dutch provinces : Groningen , Drenthe , Overijssel , Noord-Brabant ( except for the city of Eindhoven ) and Limburg . Together , these three DSOs serve the majority of inhabitants in the Netherlands . What about energy companies in the Netherlands ? With Liander being the biggest electricity system operator , who is the biggest energy supplier in the Netherlands ? As of 2018 , it was estimated that Essent/energiedirect.nl had the most clients of all private energy companies active in the country . Market data for energy suppliers in the Netherlands is something domestic sources struggle to collect . In 2004 , the Dutch government liberalized the supply of electricity and natural gas , allowing more energy suppliers to enter the market . As these companies do n't have to openly share their data , the exact market shares are difficult to determine . This is different than in for example Belgium and Luxembourg , where companies have to share their data with the local authorities . Electricity prices are going both up and down In the first half of 2018 , the average electricity price for Dutch households was 17.06 euro cents per kWh . This was the highest value reached since 2016 . The opposite development could be seen for industrial companies as industrial prices for electricity continued their decrease .
