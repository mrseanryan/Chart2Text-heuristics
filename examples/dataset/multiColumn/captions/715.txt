The largest single segment of the global accessible railway market is railway services , which is expected to have an average annual value of 38 billion euros in the period between 2021 and 2023 . However , when taken as a whole , rolling stock manufacturing is the largest segment with a combined expected value of 43 billion euros per year over the same period . Accessible market The accessible railway market refers to the portion of the overall railway supply market that is open to bids from international suppliers . This can be split into four broad areas : signaling systems , railway infrastructure , services such as engineering , consulting and maintenance , and the manufacture of various kinds of trains and locomotives ( rolling stock ) . Excluded from the railway supply market are rail operators , although this function is sometimes outsourced by governments . The total railway supply market ( including those areas not open for international competition ) is estimated at 185 billion euros . Total railway marketEurope has the largest accessible railway market , being slightly larger than the value of the American and Asian markets combined . This is due largely to the need to maintain the extensive existing rail network in the more developed European countries , which comprise a significant proportion of the global railway track given the area 's smaller geographic size relative to countries like Canada , China , Russia and the United States . However , investment in new large-scale rail projects exists mainly outside of Europe , with most of the ten-largest projects being located in the Asia Pacific region .
