In 2018 , IBM 's Technology Services and Cloud Platforms division generated over 40 percent of the company 's revenue , which was around 79 billion U.S. dollars . This is a change from 2014 and before , where the main source of revenue was Global Technology Services . In 2016 , IBM changed its segment reporting to reflect the company 's shift away from being a hardware , software and services company , and towards becoming a cognitive solutions and cloud platform company . Realignment of IBM 's software portfolio The change in business segment reporting followed IBM 's pursuit of management system and organizational changes . For example , the company created a cognitive solutions business , the segment where initiatives such as Watson , Watson health , Watson IoT , and transaction processing software are held . Merging multiple segments into one helped highlight their mutual importance to each other : linking Integration Software with Cloud Infrastructure and Platform , for example , reflected the importance of integration software to enterprise-grade hybrid clouds . These changes were made to provide investors with additional transparency on the direction of IBM 's business . Moving to the hybrid cloud One of IBM 's responses to its declining revenue is restructuring some of their business , moving into areas like cloud , blockchain , and artificial intelligence . The company looks to address its underinvestment in cloud by developing software and platform products . For example , its platform IBM Cloud aims to help customers shift their operations to the cloud environments . In early 2019 , IBM acquired open source technology company Red Hat , which offers a hybrid cloud platform . As a major and innovative player in the industry , IBM consistently spends around 5 billion U.S. dollars on research and development , such as on advances in quantum computing and artificial intelligence .
