In 2018 , Adidas had a net income of 1.7 billion euros , in comparison Puma 's net income amounted to 83.3 million euros . Adidas and Puma are two of the largest and most recognizable sports companies in the world . Both companies hold a noteworthy volume share of the highly fragmented and saturated clothing and apparel market . Background of Adidas & Puma Both sporting goods manufacturers originate from Germany . Adidas and Puma used to be one company named Gebr√ºder Dassler Schuhfabrik ( Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory ) , established by two brothers , Adolf and Rudolf Dassler in the 1920s . 24 years after the foundation of this company , the Dassler brothers separated over an argument , leading to the creation of two distinct companies . Adolf Dassler set up Adidas , while his brother Rudolf established Puma . Since then , both companies have developed into multinational companies , generating billions of euros in revenues annually . They remain strong competitors , as both design and manufacture footwear , apparel , and accessories . How do these companies compare with market leader Nike ? Surprisingly , Nike 's net income is on a similar level with that of adidas as it fell significantly between 2017 and 2018 to just under two billion U.S. dollars . Nike is the world 's leading athletic apparel brand , dwarfing their nearest competitor adidas in terms of brand value .
