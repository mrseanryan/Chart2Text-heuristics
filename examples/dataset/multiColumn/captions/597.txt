Deloitte 's employee experience Next to the Americas region , Deloitte employed approximately 102,000 members of staff in Europe , the Middle East , and Africa ( EMEA ) in 2019 , which is around one third of their total number of employees worldwide . Of all the personnel worldwide in 2019 , more than 250,000 were professional staff members working , for example , as qualified auditors , tax advisors , or lawyers . Further analysis of Deloitte 's employee figures in 2019 shows that 137,000 staff members were women , which is 44 percent of their total workforce . Is the accounting industry at risk ? Deloitte is one of the Big Four accounting firms – also known as audit firms or professional services networks . The dominance of this group of four is highlighted by the fact that in 2018 , the joint revenue of the firms ranked from fifth to ninth was as large as the smallest of the Big Four . There is growing concern that if one of the Big Four collapses – as happened to American firm Arthur Andersen in 2002 – the remaining three might not have the resources to cope and could struggle to absorb all of the work , leaving all the clients of the failed firm facing the prospect of financial ruin .
