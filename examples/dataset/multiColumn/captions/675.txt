Create more possibilities by connecting devices Wearable devices are electronic devices fitted with sensors that can be worn on the body or carried as an accessory . Some are used for a singular purpose , such as fitness trackers , which are used to monitor the personal health of an individual ; however , by connecting a wearable device to Bluetooth , Wi-Fi , or even a cellular network , it can perform many more tasks . For instance , a smartwatch and a smartphone can work together via a Bluetooth connection to enable the user to receive notifications and messages on their smartwatch â€“ a function that ranked highest among users in the United States .
