In 2018 , agriculture contributed around 21.2 percent to Nigeria 's GDP , 25.75 percent came from industry , and 52.01 percent from the services sector . Economic sectors The most common breakdown of economic activity in a country is looking at three economic sectors : The primary sector , which involves agriculture , forestry , and fishing , the secondary sector , industry , that includes manufacturing , processing , or transforming goods , and finally , the tertiary sector , services , i.e . providing information or services to consumers , such as in IT , tourism , or banking . A country 's contribution to GDP , and thus its own economy , is easily visible when looking at the performance of these three sectors . Soaring services in Nigeria Like in most thriving economies nowadays , the services sector is gaining momentum in Nigeria , because more and more people are moving from the countryside to the cities to find jobs . Nigeria is a mixed economy which focuses mainly on telecommunications , financial services , and technology , a strategy that is likely to pay off in the future and will see its GDP soaring . Nigeria 's reliance on oil is also an important contributor to its economic success ; between 2001 and 2010 , it was one of the countries with the highest GDP growth worldwide . However , oil prices are also responsible for a GDP growth slump in 2016 and for the first trade deficit in over a decade .
