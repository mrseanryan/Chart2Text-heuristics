The world 's aircraft fleet is expected to increase from 25,830 to 50,660 aircraft between 2018 and 2038 . While the more established markets of Europe and North America are predicted to increase by around 77 and 45 percent respectively , the Asia Pacific fleet is expected to increase by about 146 percent to 19,420 aircraft in 2038 . Commercial aviation The above figures relate only to commercial aviation , meaning aircraft for hire operated by companies to transport passengers and/or cargo . This figure does not include military or private aircraft . When business jets are included the forecasted growth trend looks slightly different , with the number of aircraft deliveries in North America and Europe expected to be higher than in the Asia Pacific region . Currently , North America has by far the largest fleet of business aircraft . Airline market growth All regions are predicted to see an increase in the size of their aircraft fleet over the next 20 years . The forecasted increase in aircraft fleet results from the expectation that the next two decades will see ongoing , consistent growth in both air passengers and air cargo . These growth forecasts may change though if significant regulatory change is introduced to address environmental concerns . Depending on political conditions there is a chance this may occur ; for example , almost half of U.K. consumers agree that tickets prices should be increased to reflect the environmental damage caused by flying .
