Waiting times for organs Among the Eurotransplant community ( composed of Austria , Belgium , Croatia , Germany , Hungary , Luxembourg , Netherlands and Slovenia ) almost two thousand individuals died while on the transplant waiting list in 2017 . Over half of those that died on the list were waiting for a kidney , followed by around a quarter waiting for a liver . Situation in the UK In the period 2018/19 , almost four thousand organ donations were carried out in the UK , this figure has generally increased in recent years . There were over six thousand patients on the transplant waiting list in the UK in 2018 , indicating that although the number of transplants is increasing , the amount is still not enough to match the demand for organs .
