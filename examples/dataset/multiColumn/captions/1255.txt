This statistic shows the approximate cost breakdowns for LED-based luminaires in the United States , by lamp type . Assembly costs accounted for three percent of the total costs associated with outdoor area lamps . About 13 percent of the cost of an outdoor LED area lamp is from the LED package . LED Lighting in the United States A light-emitting diode ( LED ) is a two-lead semiconductor source of light that emits light based on an electroluminescence effect . Globally , about 13 percent of LED lighting is currently used for automotive purposes and about 12 percent for signage . Different energy band gaps in the semiconductor can determine the color that is emitted by the LED . The first practical LED was created in 1962 , which emitted a low-intensity infrared light and is still commonly used today . LEDs are often considered a better alternative to incandescent lights as they consume less energy , last longer , and are more physically robust . In 2007 , the U.S. Energy Independence and Security Act banned the use of 100 watt incandescent lights , and in 2012 , California abolished the sales of incandescent lights . Today , the United States imports and exports a large volume of LEDs . In 2009 , the U.S. imported about 672.6 million U.S. dollars in value of LED lighting . The country primarily imports lights from China , South Korea , Mexico , and Canada . LEDs currently have a higher initial cost than other conventional lighting , but its reduced maintenance cost from extended lifetime provides a longer-term cost savings . For an outdoor area lamp , almost half the cost is associated with the mechanical , thermal , and electrical aspects . About 10.8 percent of LED lamps in the U.S. lamp inventory are dedicated to outdoor lighting . In a typical LED package in the United States , 30 percent of the cost is from packaging and about 23 percent is for the epitaxy . The epitaxy is a technique used to grow additional layers of semiconductor crystals on the surface of the wafer . If defects arise during this process , it can impact the performance , reliability , and yield of the device .
