Starbucks just keeps on growing Over the past 10 years the number of Starbucks stores worldwide have increased annually - the only exception being in 2009 where a dip was recorded due to the global financial crisis . The financial crisis did n't hinder the chain for long as there have been over 14 thousand new Starbucks stores opened globally in the past 10 years - the store count growing by over 70 percent since 2008 . Is China becoming the new global Starbucks capital ? China has only a quarter of the number of Starbucks stores of the U.S. - however the growth rate over the past 10 years has been extremely high , reaching almost 700 percent . The coffeehouse chain recently laid out plans to compete with KFC to become the fastest-growing Western food chain in China . It wants to do this by opening a new store every 15 hours until the year 2022 . While it may not reach the same number of stores as in the U.S. , it is speeding headfirst towards a similar store count if it continues with its rapid expansion plans .
