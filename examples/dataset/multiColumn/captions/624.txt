In 2019 , the vacancy rate of rental housing units in the South region of United States was equal to 8.2 percent . This means that 8.2 percent of available rental housing units were vacant in that years . The Midwest had the next highest vacancy rate , followed by the Northeast and then the West . The vacancy rates has fallen in all regions since 2014 , but the regional differences still remain clear . Why this divide exists ? The share of the U.S. population living in the Midwest and the South has been decreasing over the past few decades , whereas the Northeast and the West are experiencing greater population growth . These demographic changes mean that demand for housing is decreasing in the former and increasing in the latter . The Northeast and the West contain more large urban areas , which attract more residents than rural areas due to greater employment opportunities , among other reasons . The median sales prices of homes are greater in the Northeast and West than in the other two regions . The rate at which prices in the regions with higher prices are growing is also faster .
