Norway had the highest price tags on new passenger cars sold in 2017 . Like four years previous , Norwegians had to dig deeper into their pockets than any of their European neighbors , with prices roughly 20,000 euros higher than the EU-28 average . Reasons for automobiles being so costly in Norway are partly due to higher tax rates than in most other European countries . A VAT of 25 percent is imposed on all new and used passenger vehicles imported into the country , while registration tax on cars considers weight , CO2 and NOx emissions of the car . These incentives contribute to making larger , heavier vehicles using petrol and diesel engines more expensive than anywhere else in Europe . The only vehicles exempt from VAT and tolls were electric cars . Car tax rates in Nordic countries higher on average Other European countries with a 25 percent tax rate on acquisition are Croatia , Denmark and Sweden , while those in Hungary even exceeded Norwegian rates by two percent . As seen in this statistic higher tax rates on passenger cars translates to higher prices overall . Sweden and Denmark both appeared in the top seven most expensive car buying countries . Hence , in terms of volume of new car registrations , Northern European countries trailed behind not only their more populous neighbors , but also other smaller countries where tax rates were lower . Prices for passenger cars to stay stable Prices for passenger cars were forecast to stay relatively stable in the next three years , with only slight increases expected . Luxury cars were the only group where price change was estimated to be more prominent .
