This statistic shows the results of survey among Americans on whether they consider themselves pro-life of pro-choice regarding abortion from 2003 to 2019 . In 2019 , 46 percent of respondents stated they consider themselves pro-choice , meaning they would leave the decision to abort a pregnancy up to the pregnant woman . Pro-life supporters , which made up 49 percent as well in the same year , on the other hand , oppose abortion altogether . Abortion in the United States Abortion and the question whether one is pro-life ( and thus against abortion ) or pro-choice ( i.e . in favor of abortion ) is a controversial topic in the United States and the subject of many heated discussions . Before the notorious `` Roe vs. Wade '' decision of the Supreme Court in 1973 , abortion was illegal in most U.S. states and only legal under certain circumstances in others . In short , the case `` Roe vs. Wade '' was a milestone in granting women freedom over their own body , making abortion legal , as it ruled that a woman 's right to privacy included her unborn child , and set regulations for the availability of abortions . Ever since this decision , there have been two main mindsets ( with many variations ) when it comes to abortion . One is the pro-life attitude , which deems abortion murder and considers life starting at conception . The other is the pro-choice movement , which focuses on the well-being of the mother and insists that the woman alone should decide whether she wants to keep a baby or not . Politically , pro-lifers are usually seen as conservative , often belonging to the Republican camp , while pro-choicers are usually regarded as liberals who lean towards the Democrats . Of course , exceptions are not uncommon . Morally speaking , the majority of Americans still think abortion is wrong , However , the pro-choicers seem to have taken the lead over the pro-lifers in recent years , as can be seen above . When asked if they think what Americans think in general , they answer accordingly , considering most of the fellow Americans to be pro-choice .
