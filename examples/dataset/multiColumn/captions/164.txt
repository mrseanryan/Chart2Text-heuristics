The statistic represents U.S. energy consumption in 2017 and 2018 , with a breakdown by energy source . In the United States consumed some 30.98 quadrillion British thermal units of energy derived from natural gas in 2018 . Energy consumption by source Petroleum is the main source of energy in the United States . The liquid is predominantly utilized as a fuel in the transportation sector , which is also the second-largest consumer of energy in the U.S. , with a proportion of over 28 percent of the country 's total energy consumption . This figure is topped only by the energy-guzzling industrial sector - a major consumer of fossil fuels such as petroleum and natural gas . Despite the prevalence of fossil fuels in the U.S. energy mix , the use of renewable energy sources has grown from immensely in the last decades to approximately 95 million metric tons of oil equivalent in 2017 . Most of the renewable energy produced in the United States is derived from biomass , hydro and wind sources . More often than not , renewable energy is converted into electricity . In 2017 , renewable electricity accounted for approximately 17.7 percent of the nation 's total electricity generation . In the long run , it is projected that renewable power will replace petroleum as the main fuel in motor vehicles , once the internal combustion motor - that revolutionized the world in the early 19th century - has been marginalized by alternative propulsion technologies .
