With headquarters in Houston , Texas , Nabors Industries Ltd. is projected to generate the highest revenue in its sector at 3.69 billion U.S. dollars in 2020 . The company operates the most land drilling rigs in the world , and is expected to remain in close competition with another Houston-based company , Patterson-UTI Energy Inc. Unstable oil markets Over the last few years , Helmerich & Payne , Inc. of Tulsa , Oklahoma has also been a major competitor , generating nearly double the revenue of Patterson-UTI in 2015 before the market severely oscillated during the 2010s oil glut . Prices were hit across the industry as a result of surplus supply , and revenue plummeted by 2016 . Overproduction of shale oil in the United States strongly impacted the industry as new methods of extraction , such as hydraulic fracturing , came into more frequent use . Aftermath of oil glut Before the crash , Helmerich & Payne 's revenue was over a third higher than that of Patterson UTI . However , in recent years , the company has struggled to regain its former rates while Patterson UTI has been exceeding them . Meanwhile , Nabors Industries has not recovered as large a lead as it once held in the industry , with revenue still below that of 2015 .
