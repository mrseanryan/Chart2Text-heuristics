This statistic illustrates the market share of grocers in Great Britain ( GB ) monthly from January 2015 to January 2020 . Tesco and Sainsbury 's had the largest share over the period under consideration , holding 43.1 percent of the market together as of January 2020 . In March of 2019 Asda 's share surpassed Sainsbury 's which could recover the second position in the following month . Prior to the popularity of the discounters , the grocery retail market was dominated by the 'big four ' supermarkets : Tesco , Sainsbury 's , Asda and Morrisons . On the back of the post-Brexit uncertainty and growing inflation , however , consumer behavior has shifted in favor of cheaper alternatives such as Aldi and Lidl.The resulting 'price wars ' have led to supermarkets lowering their prices . Crucially , this has caused increased volatility in the grocery retail market and , as of January 2017 , Aldi overtook the Co-operative to become the fifth largest supermarket in the United Kingdom . After a period of intense competition Lidl overtook Waitrose and is now poised to likely overtake the Cooperative in the coming year .
