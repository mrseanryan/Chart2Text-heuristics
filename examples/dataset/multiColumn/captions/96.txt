This statistic illustrates the global rare earth reserves as estimated as of 2019 , by country . In that year , India was estimated to own reserves of approximately 6.9 million metric tons of rare-earth oxides . Rare earth reserves According to estimates by the U.S. Geological Survey , the worldwide reserves of rare earths are approximately 120 million metric tons . Most of these reserves are located within China , and are estimated at some 44 million metric tons . The United States also owns significant reserves , which are estimated to be some 1.4 million metric tons . In addition , within the major rare earth holding countries are India , Australia , Brazil and Malaysia . With over 132,000 metric tons produced from mines in 2018 , China by far exploited most of its rare earths reserves . China produces most of these amounts in Inner Mongolia . The United States , which is the second largest producer of rare earths from mines , extracted some 26,000 metric tons of these commodities in the same year . Rare earth elements , also called rare earth metals , are a group of 17 chemical elements . The largest subgroup within it are the 15 lanthanides . The two other elements are scandium and yttrium . Based on quantity , the lanthanides cerium , lanthanum and neodymium are the most produced rare earths elements . Yttrium , one of the rare earths that was explored first , has its name from the town where it was found â€“ Ytterby , Sweden . Nowadays , rare earth elements are crucial for a number of key technologies such as medical technology and energy technology . They are used , among many other things , for lasers , battery electrodes , magnets , MRI contrast agents , catalysts , alloys , etc . It is expected that in the near future , most of the rare earth metals will be needed for magnets and metal alloys .
