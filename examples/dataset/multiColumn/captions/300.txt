Purchase loan mortgage originations in the third quarter of 2019 amounted to 375 billion U.S. dollars and refinance loan mortgage originations amounted to 230 billion U.S. dollars . Refinance loans were more popular than purchase loans in 2012 , but this trend has been changing since early-2014 and became more pronounced as of 2017 . Purchase vs refinance loans A purchase loan is the classic type of mortgage which describes the process by which a home buyer borrows money from a mortgage lender . On the other hand , a refinance loan is obtained by homeowners to replace their existing mortgage with a new loan , which usually reduces the monthly payments , the interest rate or changes it to a fixed rate mortgage . Why the trend has changed The value of refinance loans has been falling since mid-2013 , because the Federal Reserve has been continuously increasing the interest rate since 2014 . However , the volume of purchase mortgage originations has been rising due to a stable economy and a thriving housing market .
