Is porn consumed only by men ? It seems that this stereotype is still partly true in 2019 . In Europe , men are the main visitors of the porn website Pornhub . This can indicate that pornographic viewing remains an activity mostly done by men . However , Sweden and Poland female visitors of Pornhub accounted for 35 percent of all visitors from their countries . Furthermore , approximatively a quarter of visitors were women in other European countries . In other words , women also appear to consume porn . A gender-gap in frequency of porn consumption In 2014 , French men were more frequently visiting pornographic sites than women . A quarter of responding men visited such websites at least once a week in France , whereas only three percent of women declared that they visited one in a week . For this reason , it could be discussed that even though women do consume porn , in terms of frequency men are the main consumers . Porn consumption parallels the evolution of technology Long gone is the reign of magazines , videotapes and even DVDs . Nowadays , pornographic websites , like Pornhub , are leading the industry . With technology evolving , more and more people are visiting these websites on their mobile phones . In the Netherlands , such mobile phone use grew from 51 percent in 2015 to 62 percent in 2018 . Similar findings were discovered in France . In spite of this , pornography remains a sensitive topic , at least in the U.S. , where over half of Americans stated that porn was morally wrong .
