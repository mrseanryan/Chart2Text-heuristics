The load factor for electricity generation from both small scale and large-scale hydropower in UK has fluctuated since 2010 . In 2018 , the load factor of small-scale hydro decreased from the previous year to 37 percent . Load factors were typically lower for large scale hydro , except in 2015 . Load factors are the ratio of how much electricity was produced as a share of the total generating capacity . Role of hydropower in the energy mix In 2018 , hydropower accounted for approximately five percent of renewable electricity generation in the UK , generating 5,464 gigawatt-hours of electricity . Most of this was produced by large scale hydro . However , generation from small scale hydro has increased significantly since 2010 . Scottish hydropower With its high levels of rainfall , mountains and lakes , Scotland unsurprisingly accounts for more than 80 percent of the hydroelectric resources in the UK . The cumulative capacity of hydropower in Scotland reached 1,655 megawatts in 2018 . In comparison , the installed capacity in England was just 44 megawatts in the same year .
