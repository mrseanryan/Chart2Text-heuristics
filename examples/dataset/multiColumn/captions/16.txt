In 2019 , 43.21 percent of the workforce in India were employed in agriculture , while the other half was almost evenly distributed among the two other sectors , industry and services . While the share of Indians working in agriculture is declining , it is still the main sector of employment . A BRIC powerhouse Together with Brazil , Russia , and China , India makes up the four so-called BRIC countries . They are the four fastest-growing emerging countries dubbed BRIC , an acronym , by Jim O'Neill at Goldman Sachs . Being major economies themselves already , these four countries are said to be at a similar economic developmental stage -- on the verge of becoming industrialized countries -- and maybe even dominating the global economy . Together , they are already larger than the rest of the world when it comes to GDP and simple population figures . Among these four , India is ranked second across almost all key indicators , right behind China . Services on the rise While most of the Indian workforce is still employed in the agricultural sector , it is the services sector that generates most of the country 's GDP . In fact , when looking at GDP distribution across economic sectors , agriculture lags behind with a mere 15 percent contribution . Some of the leading services industries are telecommunications , software , textiles , and chemicals , and production only seems to increase â€“ currently , the GDP in India is growing , as is employment .
