In the United States , coal as a source of net electricity generation has declined over the last years , decreasing to 1,146 terawatt hours in 2018 from a peak of 2,013 terawatt hours in 2005 . In contrast , there has been a rise in natural gas and renewable sources for electricity generation . Natural gas has even surpassed coal as the most common source of energy , accounting for 35 percent of electricity generation . Overall , electricity generation from electric utilities has decreased in the U.S. Electricity generation in the U.S . Most electricity is generated from steam turbines through the use of fossil fuels , nuclear , biomass , geothermal , and solar thermal energy . Other systems such as gas turbines , hydro turbines , wind turbines , and solar photovoltaics are also major generation technologies . Fossil fuels currently remain the most common source of electricity , especially natural gas , which uses steam and gas turbines to generate electricity . Nuclear power is the second most used source of electricity and generates electricity from nuclear fission through steam turbines . A wide variety of renewable sources have become more prominent in recent years , including hydroelectricity , wind energy , solar energy , and geothermal .
