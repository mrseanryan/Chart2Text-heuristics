China was the leading graphite producing country worldwide as of 2019 . In that year they produced an estimated 700,000 metric tons of graphite . Graphite 's end-uses Graphite is an allotrope of carbon that is comprised of layers of carbon atoms . These layers can slide over each other easily , making it a very soft mineral . It is dull grey in appearance and metallic in luster . It conducts electricity easily because there are electrons between the layers of carbon atoms . Under high pressures and temperatures , graphite turns into diamonds . This process is actually how synthetic diamonds are produced . Due to its high conductivity , graphite is used in electrodes , batteries , and solar panels . Some other uses include being used in pencils ( as it is well known as â€˜ pencil lead ' _ ) , and lubricants . Graphite was first used during the Neolithic Age as a paint . Since it was discovered in England around the year 1565 , the use of graphite has increased . Graphite mining worldwide In 2019 , the total worldwide production volume of graphite was an estimated 1.1 million metric tons . Even though China is world 's leading producer of graphite , the country 's graphite reserves are second-largest worldwide . The country with the largest volume of graphite reserves in the world is Turkey . In 2019 , they had approximately 90 million metric tons of natural graphite reserves . China accounts for the highest share of the United States ' graphite imports , accounting for a 37 percent share of total U.S. graphite imports between 2014 and 2017 .
