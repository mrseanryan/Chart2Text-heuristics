This statistic shows L'Oréal 's global revenue from 2012 to 2018 , by division . In 2016 , the Body Shop division of L'Oréal generated approximately 920.8 million euros in revenue . L'Oréal Founded in 1909 , the L'Oréal Group has devoted itself solely to one business : beauty . It is a business rich in meaning , as it enables all individuals to express their personalities , gain self-confidence and open up others . L'Oréal has set itself the mission of offering all women and men worldwide the best of cosmetics innovation in terms of quality , efficacy and safety . Providing access to products that enhance well-being , L'Oréal has made the universalization of beauty its project for the years to come . The L'Oréal Group has become the largest cosmetics and beauty company in the world . In 2016 , L'Oréal was the leading personal care brand in the world with a brand value that amounted to 23.52 billion U.S. dollars . Once again , 2016 was a good year for L'Oréal on many fronts . The Group achieved strong sales growth and once again demonstrated its ability to outperform the beauty market , and to gain market share , even in the more difficult markets of Western Europe and the United States . In 2016 , L'Oréal also continued to reflect the integration of the Group 's internationalization , as the `` new markets '' segment remained to be the company 's number one geographic zone in terms of sales . The company 's cosmetic branch is primarily focused on skin care , hair care , make-up , hair colorants and perfumes . In 2016 , skincare generated almost 30 percent of L'Oréal 's global cosmetic sales ; amounting to over seven billion euros . The company did have a void in terms of addressing young consumers looking for affordable yet exciting color cosmetics , which Urban Decay is expected to fulfill . However , it needs to address its presence in the affordable natural/organic segment going forward .
