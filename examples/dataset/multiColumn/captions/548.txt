Even though Spain is continually losing its nationals , the inflow migration figures of the European country saw an increase over the last few years , ceasing the country 's ongoing downward trend in population in 2016 . The population of Spain has been in decline for many years and was projected to decrease by nearly one million by 2023 . A matter of balance The net migration rate of Spain changed its course mainly due to the great inflow of foreigners that move to reside in the Mediterranean country . Spain 's immigration flow slowed down after the 2008 financial crisis , albeit the number of foreigners that opted to change their residence saw a significant growth in the last years . In 2017 , Moroccans ranked first as the foreign nationality that most relocated to Spain , closely followed by Colombians and Venezuelans . Spain does not have the highest number of immigrants in Europe In 2015 , the European Union confronted a rising number of refugees arriving from the Middle East . Migration figures show that Germany accommodated approximately 14 million foreign-born citizens , ranking it as the country that most hosted immigrants in Europe in 2018 . By comparison , Spain 's foreign population stood merely over six million , positioning the Western Mediterranean country sixth on the European list of foreign-born population .
