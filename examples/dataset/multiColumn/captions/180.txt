Over the last decade , Japan 's population has aged more and more , to the point where more than a quarter of Japanese were 65 years and older in 2018 . Population growth has stopped and even reversed , since it 's been in the red for several years now . It 's getting old With almost 30 percent of its population being elderly inhabitants , Japan is considered the `` oldest '' country in the world today . Japan boasts a high life expectancy , in fact , the Japanese tend to live longer than the average human worldwide . The increase of the aging population is accompanied by a decrease of the total population caused by a sinking birth rate . Japan 's fertility rate has been below the replacement rate for many decades now , mostly due to economic uncertainty and thus a decreasing number of marriages . Are the Japanese invincible ? There is no real mystery surrounding the ripe old age of so many Japanese . Their high average age is very likely due to high healthcare standards , nutrition , and an overall high standard of living â€“ all of which could be adopted by other industrial nations as well . But with high age comes less capacity , and Japan 's future enemy might not be an early death , but rather a struggling social network .
