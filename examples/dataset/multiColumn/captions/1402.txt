The Rugby Football Union ( RFU ) is the governing body of rugby union in England . History During the end of the 18th century British public schools , almost exclusively attended by boys from the more affluent upper classes , were governed by strict and often cruel disciplinary action in lessons . In contrast to this , the Masters were almost entirely ambivalent to the activities that took place outside the classroom , the resulting ‘ boy culture ' of bullying and brutality quickly became an issue that had to be addressed . In the early 19th century the Headmaster of Rugby School , Dr Thomas Arnold recognized the potential of a group sport activity to occupy the time of the mischievous students whilst simultaneously introducing positive Christian values , in a concept known as ‘ muscular Christianity ' _ . The successful use of games as a vehicle for achieving social control in Rugby School lead to a similar application of muscular Christianity across the increasingly expanding number of public schools . Although many schools adopted a form of group competitive activity , the precise rules of the game varied significantly from school to school , and subsequently from club to club , often formed by former public school boy that wished to continue participating in their sport . In the late 19th Century two proponents of the game published a letter in The Times suggesting that `` those who play the rugby-type game should meet to form a code of practice as various clubs play to rules which differ from others , which makes the game difficult to play . '' On 26 January 1871 during a meeting attended by representatives from 21 clubs , the RFU was founded . Although similar unions were organized during the next few years in Ireland , Wales , Scotland , New Zealand , Australia , France , Canada , South Africa , and the United States , the RFU was the first and therefore had no need to distinguish itself from others by calling itself the English RFU . The RFU was a founding member of the sport 's international governing body , World Rugby in 1887 . Objectives The RFU describes its primary objective as to encourage rugby , and its values , to flourish across England : It promotes and runs the sport , organizes international matches for the England national team , and educates and trains players and officials . Income In 2019 the RFU earned approximately 213.2 million British pounds , with the majority of this income is attributed to ticket sales , broadcasting , sponsorship and hospitality and catering . In 2019 the revenue associated with ticket sales was approximately 47.6 million British pounds , an increase of over 17 million British Pounds from the previous year . Similar increases can be observed in the revenue associated with broadcasting , sponsorship and hospitality and catering .
