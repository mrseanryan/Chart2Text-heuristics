In 2018 , the total global production output of the chemical fiber industry amounted to 73.4 million metric tons . Chemical fibers are made from organic ( `` natural '' ) and synthetic polymers . Chemical fibers are manufactured industrially for various purposes . For example , polypropylene fibers are produced for upholstery textiles . Chemical fibers account for the majority of textile fibers produced worldwide . Chemical fiber production worldwide Global production of chemical fibers has seen considerable growth since 2000 . In 2000 , some 31 million metric tons of chemical fibers were produced . By 2018 , some 73.4 million metric tons of chemical fibers were produced globally , of which 66.6 million metric tons were synthetic fibers and 6.8 million metric tons were cellulose fibers . In 2018 , a total of some 105.6 million metric tons of textile fibers were produced . In 2018 , some 90 percent of chemical fiber production took place outside the U.S. , Western Europe , Japan , and Germany . Chemical fibers are made from organic ( `` natural '' ) and synthetic polymers . They are manufactured industrially for various purposes . Polypropylene fibers are produced for upholstery textiles . Acrylic fibers are used in filters and artificial wool for sweaters . Nylon fibers are essential to the hosiery industry and to carpet manufacturing . Teflon is a chemical fiber used as a sealant for pipe threads and vessels . It can be found in self-lubricating bearings . Kevlar , another chemical fiber , is a key component in bullet-proof vests and automobile tires , as it is several times stronger than steal and is fire resistant . The textile and apparel manufacturing industry relies heavily on chemical fibers . Cotton and cotton blend fibers are the favorite fibers worn by U.S. consumers . Though natural fibers , not chemical fibers , are created from cotton , cotton blended textiles mix cotton fibers with chemical fibers to change a textile 's qualities . Polyester fibers are often blended with cotton to create crease-resistant qualities . Cotton-rayon blends are soft and fuzzy .
