There are still vast disparities between the internet access rates of male and female online users in global regions worldwide . In 2019 , 22.6 percent of Africa 's female population had online access , compared to 33.8 percent of men . In the Americas , the share of female online access was 76.8 percent . Internet access and SDGs As of 2018 , Africa 's online access rate was the lowest worldwide , with estimates showing that just a quarter of the total population were using the internet . By comparison , the global average online usage rate was 48 percent . This technological gap between Africa and the rest of the world highlights the need for continued investment in information and communication technologies on the continent , as such processes can speed up progress towards the 17 Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs ) set by the United Nations . The Sustainable Development Goals , also known as the Global Goals , are a worldwide agenda to protect the planet , end poverty and ensure global peace and prosperity . ICTs , especially mobile internet , contribute to the goals by enabling countries to participate in digital economies as well as empowering individuals to access crucial information and services . However , half of the world are currently not using the internet . Particularly disenfranchised groups are frequently excluded from digital society , including women and girls , people with disabilities , elders , indigenous populations , people living in poverty and inhabitants of least developed or developing countries . The digital gender gap is another obstacle for women to overcome on a global level in order to achieve economic advancement which will ultimately also benefit their communities . As of now , the digital potential of women is largely underutilized .
