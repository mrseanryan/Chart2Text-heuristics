U.S. sales of most classes of medium and heavy trucks have been increasing year-on-year since 2009 , with the notable exception of class 8 heavy trucks , which have fallen sharply in recent years ; in 2017 a total of 192,000 class 8 trucks were sold in the U.S. , compared to the 249,000 sold in 2015 . In 2018 , class 8 trucks sales recovered , with 251,000 units sold . Commercial vehicle classifications Commercial motor vehicles in the United States are divided into eight different classes based on weight . Light duty trucks are included in classes 1 and 2 , medium duty trucks in classes 3 to 6 , and heavy trucks in classes 7 and 8 . The weight range for each class is not consistent – for example class 3 includes trucks between 10,001 and 14,000 pounds , class 5 is between 16,001 and 19,500 pounds , and class 7 is between 26,001 and 33,000 pounds . Sales for all truck classes – including Class 8 – are expected to increase over the short term . Global commercial vehicle market Over the last decade Chinese demand for commercial vehicles has overtaken that of the United States . Based on projections , sales of trucks over 15 tons ( class 8 ) are three to four times higher in China than in the United States , while sales of trucks between 6 and 15 tons ( roughly classes 4 to 7 ) are around 50 percent higher . However , commercial vehicle production in the U.S. is higher than in China , with the 8.52 million trucks produced in the U.S. in 2018 being around twice the Chinese production numbers of that year . When considering only heavy trucks though , production is much higher in the Asia-Pacific region than in North America . This is likely due to multiple major vehicle-producing countries , such as Japan , China , Thailand and India , being located in the region .
