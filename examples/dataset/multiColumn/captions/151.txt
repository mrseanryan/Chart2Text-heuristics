Although the United Kingdom was supposed to leave the European Union on March 29,2019 , the deal which Theresa May secured proved so unpopular it was rejected by the House of Commons three times between January and March 2019 . As a result , Brexit has been delayed leading to frustration among many leave voters , especially among those that support a no-deal Brexit . A survey conducted in October 2019 indicated that support for a no-deal Brexit stood at 34 percent of people in Great Britain Effects of a no-deal Brexit A no-deal Brexit would have profound economic , political and logistical consequences for both Britain and the European Union . According to a forecast from the Bank of England there could be an 8 percent loss to gross-domestic product and an increase in the unemployment rate of 7.5 percent , while Inflation could rise by as much as 6.5 percent and house prices may decline by 30 percent . Ports could be worst hit The port of Dover is the UK 's vital link to the continent , separated by just 20 miles of water from Calais in France . Due to Britain 's membership of and single market , custom checks at Dover take an average of just 2 minutes , as of 2018 resulting in traffic queues that are usually about 10 miles long . Should Britain leave the EU without a deal , there is a fear that these custom checks could increase , with even a 4 minute customs check resulting in queues almost 40 miles in length .
