This statistic shows the forecasted annual change in rental prices in London ( UK ) between 2018 and 2022 , as of 2018 . The changes in regulations and housing policies , which were introduced in 1980 in the United Kingdom , had far-reaching impact on the structure of the housing sector and its subsectors , such as private home ownership , social housing , private rented housing and other . As a result of these changes , there was a shift away from home ownership and towards the private home rental part of the market . Private renting became prevalent , both out of need ( i.e . more difficult access to affordable housing for first-time buyers , undersupply of homes etc . ) and out of choice . The necessity of mapping the expected dynamics in rental prices became visible , to help to define trends on the ever-changing market . As the forecast for different districts of London shows , rental prices in the Greater London area for the whole period from 2018 to 2022 were expected to grow by 10.9 percent , whereas in Prime Central London the growth was expected to be three percent .
