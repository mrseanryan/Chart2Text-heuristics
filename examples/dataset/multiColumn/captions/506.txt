The global nuclear energy market is expected to grow over the next years , with the nuclear generation segment reaching 300 billion U.S. dollars . In addition to the already operable nuclear reactors all over the world , there are also nuclear reactors currently under construction , most notably in China , Russia , and India . In these countries , there are also several reactors being planned and in various stages of approval , funding , or major commitments already in place . Nuclear debate Global nuclear power generation has risen steadily over the last decades , however , the risks and benefits of using nuclear energy has long been debated . In the light of climate change , advocates often point to a reliable and emission-free electricity as an alternative to fossil fuel sources . Using nuclear energy can be considered a clean energy source with an extremely high-energy density source , uranium . Advocates also state that it is the only viable energy option for energy dependence and to reach climate goals . On the other hand , skeptics point to nuclear accidents , such as the Chernobyl , Fukushima , and Three Mile Island disasters , as well as potential targets for global terrorism . Environmental and health risks may also be cited , including accidents and environmental damage from the uranium mining process . The uncertainty behind the current methods used to store radioactive nuclear waste is also of concern .
