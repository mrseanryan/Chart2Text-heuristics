Despite the average daily time spent reading per capita in the United States decreasing in recent years , the average amount of time spent reading the Bible has remained stable . A survey showed that 23 percent of U.S. adults reported spending one hour of more with the bible in each sitting in 2017 , compared to 24 percent four years earlier . The Bible : consumption in the United States The frequency of reading the Bible among adults in the U.S. changed very little between 2018 and 2019 , however reading habits among survey respondents were at two extremes . Whilst the majority reported never reading the Bible at all , the second largest share of adults said that they read the text every day . Whilst the average time spent with the Bible has only very mildly fluctuated over the last few years , attitudes and consumption habits are changing . Back in 2011 , 67 percent of surveyed U.S. adults said that they wished they used the Bible more , however by 2019 this figure had dropped to 56 percent . In addition to this , digital formats have become more prevalent and have proved more appealing to younger readers than to older generations . Print is still by far the most popular format , however more Millennials and Gen-Xers prefer to read the Bible via a smartphone or tablet app than their older peers , and the frequency of reading online versions of the Bible was also higher among younger generations . Whilst to older generations using digital versions of religious or sacred texts may seem strange or even a step too far , clearly a demand for such content exists . The Bible app came second in a ranking of the highest rated iOS apps in the United States with over 97 percent positive user reviews â€“ that 's almost ten percent more than Spotify . With consumers all over the world making the move from print to digital , it is possible that digital versions of the Bible will increase in popularity even further , though there will likely always be groups who simply believe such a text should be kept in its traditional format .
