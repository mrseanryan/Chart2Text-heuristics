Men were consecutively more likely than women to pass practical driving tests in the United Kingdom . In the past eleven years , the gap between pass rates for male and female participants has stayed relatively stable , recording a net increase of 2.3 percent for men and 1.1 percent for women . This was despite a noticeable slump in the most recently surveyed time period . Practical and theory tests for car driving have been separated since 1997 , with the last change in practical test layout implemented in December 2017 . That month , only 45 percent of those taking the practical test had passed . Women more likely to pass theory test This statistic shows that women still struggled more than their male counterparts during the practical driving test . Interestingly , figures for pass rates of theory tests showed the exact opposite . In 2018/19 , female participants were 3.5 percent more likely than men to be successful , although the gap has been narrowing in recent years . There was a prominent decline in the share of successful theory tests . This development is likely due to new theory questions no longer being released online as of 2012 . Number of practical tests taken stable Figures for number of practical driving tests taken declined for the second consecutive year in 2018/19 , amounting to 1.66 million .
