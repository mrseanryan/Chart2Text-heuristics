Milk production Dairy farming is an agricultural business which is engaged in the long-term milk production within the dairy industry . It is a large contributor to the overall economy in many states . California , Wisconsin , New York , Idaho and Pennsylvania had the highest milk supply in 2016 . The Badger State Wisconsin is also known as â€˜ Americas Dairyland ' _ . The slogan is even engraved on its license plate . The number of U.S. dairy farms has sharply decreased in the last decades , while dairy operations have ever-larger numbers of cows concentrated on a single farm . These extensive dairy farming conditions with a large herd size and a high milk output are seen as a profitable way for the milk industry in order to provide milk at relatively low cost for the consumer . Due to its high milk volume , the main cow used for milk production is the Holstein-Friesian . However , with this intensification of milking cows there comes a corresponding concentration of manure production which causes problems and challenges for the environment such as the risk of elevated nitrogen levels or contaminated ground water . Due to these environmental impacts , many dairy operations in Wisconsin are now facing opposition regarding plans to expand their dairy herds .
