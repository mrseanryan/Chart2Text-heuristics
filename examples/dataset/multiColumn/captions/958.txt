Mobile call volume increasing The volume of calls made using mobile phones has increased over the past several years . In 2009 users of mobile phones placed 120.57 billion minutes worth of calls in the UK . By 2017 , this figure had reached 148.64 billion minutes . Mobile phone users in the UK made 36.6 billion minutes of calls during the fourth quarter of 2017 .
