The statistic shows the growth of the real gross domestic product ( GDP ) in the European Union and the Euro area from 2014 to 2018 , with projections up until 2024 . GDP refers to the total market value of all goods and services that are produced within a country per year . It is an important indicator of the economic strength of a country . Real GDP is adjusted for price changes and is therefore regarded as a key indicator for economic growth . In 2018 , the GDP in the European Union increased by about 2.2 percent compared to the previous year . Growth trends in the EU compared to the euro area The euro area , which is also called the eurozone , is an economic and monetary union ( EMU ) which includes 19 of the 28 European Union member states which have formally adopted the euro . Those countries include Austria , Belgium , Cyprus , Estonia , Finland , France , Germany , Greece , Ireland , Italy , Latvia , Lithuania , Luxembourg , Malta , the Netherlands , Portugal , Slovakia , Slovenia , and Spain . Member states which have not yet adopted the euro include Bulgaria , Croatia , Czech Republic , Denmark , Hungary , Poland , Romania , Sweden and the United Kingdom . Additionally , there is the so-called Schengen Area , which is composed of EU and non-EU states , and has been established mainly to facilitate travelling in Europe . While some countries , such as Kosovo and Montenegro have adopted the euro unilaterally , they are not formally part of the eurozone . Others have established a monetary agreement with the EU to use the euro , such as Andorra , Monaco , San Marino and the Vatican , but they do not form part of the official euro area . As can be seen in the chart , annual GDP growth slumped in 2012 and 2013 , presumably as a result of the global financial crisis , in both the EU and the euro area . In 2013 , growth began increasing ever so slightly and in 2014 the EU regained a bit of stability . However , overall recovery in the EU has been relatively moderate and gradual ; growth throughout the EU has been slightly better than in the euro area and is projected to remain slightly better for the foreseeable future . Relatively new member states such as Romania and the Czech Republic , which have not yet adopted the euro , reported the highest annual growth rates in the EU in 2015 , and generally , new member states show slightly better growth rates . Also , unemployment has been slightly higher in the euro area compared to the EU for the last ten years ( 267906 ) . The unemployment rate also remains relatively high for both the EU and the euro area . As for public spending as a share of GDP , these figures are slightly higher in the euro area than in the EU as a whole . The member states with the highest national debt include the United Kingdom , Italy , France and Germany - some of the oldest members of the euro area . The national debt of the euro area is slightly higher than the national debt of the EU as a whole , underlining the economic situation of both areas .
