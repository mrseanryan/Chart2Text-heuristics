The statistic shows the degree of adult literacy in China from 1982 to 2015 . In 2015 , the literacy rate , which is defined as people aged 15 and above who can read and write , had reached about 96.4 percent in China.Literacy and education in China â€“ additional information By 2012 , 84 percent of the world population aged 15 years and above had been able to read and write . While in developed regions this figure ranged a lot higher , only 60 percent of the African population was literate . Countries with the lowest literacy rates are also the most underdeveloped worldwide . According to UNESCO , literacy is a human right , especially in a fast-changing and technology-driven world . In China , the literacy rate has developed from 79 percent in 1982 to 97 percent in 2010 , indicating that almost one million people per year have become literate over the past three decades . In India , the situation was entirely different . The second most populous country in the world displayed a literacy rate of merely 75 percent in 2006 . The dramatic increase in literacy in China has a lot to do with the efficacy of numerous political , economic and educational policies . In 1982 , compulsory education was written into the Chinese constitution , postulating a nine-year compulsory education funded by the government . As is shown by the graph above , there was a large gender gap in literacy rate in China as of 1982 . Though this gap still existed in 2010 , it was narrowed down to 5.7 percent , starting from 28 percent in 1982 . Since 1990 , the national education policy was directed at females , especially from poor and/or minority families . Over the past years , China has achieved gender parity in primary schooling . However , regional literacy disparities in China should not to be overlooked . Regions with a strong economic background tend to display illiteracy rates below national average . In contrast , economically underdeveloped regions have a much larger share of people who can not read nor write . Tibet for instance , a region where 92 percent of the population belong to an ethnic minority , showed the highest illiterate rate nationwide , with almost 35 percent in 2012 .
