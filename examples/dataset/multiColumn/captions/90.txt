Like music , movies can be hard to pin down when it comes to which genre they are most aligned with . Cross-genre or hybrid-genre movies often have a broader appeal than those firmly lodged within a single genre – in fact , the latter types of movies can be quite divisive . A key example of this could be seen in a survey held in late 2018 , which examined the most popular movie genres among adults in the United States based on gender , age , ethnicity , income , and more . The study revealed that comedy was the favorite genre among 90 percent of men and 91 percent of women , though drama , adventure , and action were similarly popular . U.S. movie genre preferences In the U.S. , movie genre preferences varied greatly according to age when it came to stereotypically divisive genres like musicals and romantic films – 64 percent of women cited musicals as their favorite genre , compared to 48 percent of men . Comedies , thrillers , fantasy and adventure films were considered similarly favorable by each gender , with 84 percent of men saying that they had a very or somewhat favorable impression of thriller or mystery films compared to 83 percent of female respondents . The movie genre that has generated the most revenue at the North American box office since 1995 is the adventure genre , having brought in 58.84 billion U.S. dollars of revenue since that year . Second on the list is the action genre , which has box office takings of 44.15 billion U.S. dollars . Drama ranked third , and is a genre popular not only with consumers but also with producers – over 5.1 thousand drama movies have been released in the U.S. since the mid 1990s .
