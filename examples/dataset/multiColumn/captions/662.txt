This statistic shows the results of a survey conducted irregularly between 1958 and 2013 among adult Americans , asking them if they approve of marriage between people of different skin color . While in 1958 , only 4 percent stated they approved of intermarriages , 87 percent said the same in 2013 . The growing acceptance of interracial marriages The remarkable change in approval of interracial marriage amongst Americans displays an ongoing trend of public acceptance of lifestyles that were once disapproved of . The once frowned-upon concept of interracial relationships has correspondingly changed with the evolution of American culture as well as new generations . Interracial relationships were often a topic of debate , however , these debates have since become less conservative , with many citing the positivity of racially mixed marriages for the development of society . The United States , despite its history , has become an openly diverse country , with a multitude of immigrants becoming legal U.S. citizens and gaining rights , most notably from Asia . Based on a recent survey in 2010 , it was evident that interracial marriages in the United States were primarily present with Hispanics and Asians . The change in the opinion of U.S. citizens regarding interracial marriage is obvious within the different generations , whether it is the older or the younger ; however the concept is most definitely easier accepted within the latter , something that is most evidently seen within pop culture and sports .
