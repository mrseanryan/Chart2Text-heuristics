U.S. tech companies are currently the most valuable brands in the world , covering the four top spots in 2019 . Apple led the list with a brand value of around 234 billion U.S. dollars , followed by Google , Amazon and Microsoft . The highest-ranked non-tech company was Coca-Cola in fifth place , and the highest non-U.S. company was Samsung in sixth . ‘ Brand value ' Brand value is determined by the source using a combination of financial information , the role the brand plays in determining consumer choice ( independent of other factors such as price and convenience ) , and a qualitative assessment of the brand 's overall strength . If only financial data is taken into account then the same four companies are at the top , with Apple , Amazon , Alphabet ( Google 's parent company ) and Microsoft having the highest global market capitalizations . However , if only the qualitative factors regarding brand strength are considered the list looks very different , with Italian carmaker Ferrari being the strongest brand in 2019 . ‘ Brand value vs. profitability ' Brand value does not always translate into profitability . While Apple also happens to be the second most profitable company in the world , other companies with a strong brand such as Google and Amazon rank lower in terms of net income . This phenomenon does not only apply to tech companies – Coca-Cola also does not feature on the list of the most profitable companies worldwide . This is likely due to their franchised distribution structure , whereby manufacturing operations are handed by separate companies , each of which operates independently with an exclusive license to manufacture Coca Cola beverages in their territory .
