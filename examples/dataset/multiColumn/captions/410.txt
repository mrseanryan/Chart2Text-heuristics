In the last couple decades , the price of natural gas used for electricity generation has increased slightly to 3.55 U.S. dollars per million British thermal units ( Btu ) in 2018 . The price of coal was about 2.06 U.S. dollars per million Btu . The cost of using some fossil fuels to generate electricity has been recently found to be more expensive than renewable energy . Natural gas is cheapest in regions like the Coastal Plain , where natural gas production is high . Shift Away from Conventional Energy Sources Although renewable technologies were once thought to be very expensive , the rapid advancement of these technologies have quickly rendered the cost of energy generation at a level on par to conventional fossil fuels . The aging coal fleet is a prime example of the increasing necessity to switch to carbon neutral technologies . Older coal plants are dealing with increasing maintenance costs as well as environmental regulations forcing the installation of pollution controls . Demand for natural gas is also impacting coal demand . Unlike wind and solar resources , natural gas resources seem to be sensitive to carbon prices .
