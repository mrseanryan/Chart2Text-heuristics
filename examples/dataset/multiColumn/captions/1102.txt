In 2040 , the nominal price of the OPEC reference basket oil is expected to reach 155 U.S. dollars . The nominal price is an unadjusted number , without taking elements such as inflation , seasonality , loan fees , interest compounding into account . Prices rising and recovering The `` real price '' ( in 2015 U.S. dollars ) of oils in the OPEC reference basket is projected to more than double from 2016 to 2040 . While the average annual OPEC crude oil price was at the lowest point in over a decade in 2016 and had room to recover , real 2015 prices are not expected to reach the high levels of the early 2010s over the next twenty years . Turbulence in the 2010s As oil prices fluctuated heavily during the 2008 financial crisis , the United States sought to decrease reliance on imports from OPEC countries and invested in domestic oil production to keep up with high demand at lower cost . The subsequent development of hydraulic fracturing enabled extraction of shale oil in the United States and brought a surge in production , causing a global oversupply by 2014 , known as the 2010s oil glut .
