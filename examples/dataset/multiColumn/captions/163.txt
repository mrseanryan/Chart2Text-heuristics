The combined number of male and female participants playing football ( 11-player ) at high school level in the United States declined for the third consecutive year in 2019 . The number of male participants dropped to around one million , whereas the number of female participants increased by around 7.5 percent to 2,404.Why is there a decline in football participation ? Football ( 11-player ) is ranked the most popular program for high school boys in the United States , ahead of outdoor track and field by more than 400,000 participants . However , the number of male participants declined for the fifth consecutive year in 2019 and could drop below one million in 2020 . One reason for the decline could be concerns about the safety of players , with concussion perceived to be the biggest health risk associated with playing football . During 2013/14 , more concussions were sustained by boys playing high school football than any other sport . Despite the number of girls playing football at high school level doubling in the last decade , the sport fails to make the top ten of the most popular girls ' programs â€“ outdoor track and field , volleyball , and basketball are the top three.The hard knocks of college football The long-term aim for the majority of talented high school footballers is to play in the National Football League ( NFL ) , but for many the transition to college football is where the dream will end . College not only demands extra focus in the classroom , there are also added pressures of performing on the field . There are the hopes of the fans : games draw huge attendances and even bigger television audiences . There are also the expectations of the board members : college football is big business and the brand value of the postseason playoffs continues to increase year-on-year . Players face many challenges in college football , but if they can cope with the added demands , the dream of playing in the NFL can be more of a reality .
