This statistic shows the age structure in Syria from 2008 to 2018 . In 2018 , about 31.42 percent of Syria 's total population were aged 0 to 14 years . The shrinking population of Syria In the past , Syria 's population has been one of the fastest growing populations around the world . While the fertility rate is much lower now than it has been , in 2013 , World Bank figures show a fertility rate of 3 children per woman . This rate is still relatively high , but the country 's historically expanding population has left the country with a large cohort of young people : Almost 40 percent of the Syrian population is under 14 years of age , with close to 60 percent of the population aged 15 to 64 . This leaves around a meager 4 percent of Syrians who are over 65 years old . At present , the median age of the population is estimated to be around 23 years , which means half the population is under 23 , leaving large numbers of young people at the mercy of the war that has plagued the country . As of October 2015 , 12,517 children were reportedly killed in the fighting , with the number of unreported cases being presumably much higher than this . This dire situation has caused many people to flee the country and it is no surprise that the majority of them are young . Despite a high fertility rate , this mass emigration has significantly stalled population growth in the country , a trend which is expected to continue especially as an overwhelming majority of Syrians â€“ 46 percent - stated they would leave the country if given the opportunity .
