Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid used particularly in the treatment of pain in cancer patients . It is most commonly administered using a patch directly applied to the skin . It is believed to be 100 times more potent than morphine . It is often sold as a heroin-like substance to recreational opioid users . As of 2017 , the price of 1 kg of pure fentanyl for a drug trafficking organization ( DTO ) was about 4,150 U.S. dollars . Comparatively , heroin sold to DTOs for about 6,000 U.S. dollars . The revenue generated from 1 kg of fentanyl by a DTO is estimated to equal about 1.6 million U.S. dollars . The U.S. opioid epidemic The U.S. is currently experiencing an opioid use epidemic like it has never seen before . The United States is responsible for the greatest share of fentanyl consumption globally . The total number of heroin users in the U.S. has increased over the last several years . Opioids are obtained through both illegal and legal methods in the United States as drugs like hydrocodone , oxycodone and morphine are commonly distributed by doctors . Fighting the epidemic A recent survey among law enforcement personnel found that a large percentage of those working in the Mid-Atlantic , New England and New York/New Jersey area said that heroin was highly available in their regions . However , despite law enforcement 's awareness of the opioid epidemic there are still several barriers that prevent successful reductions in opioid use . A recent survey found that a majority of adults believed that the overprescribing of opioids and lack of access to treatment are significant barriers in the fight against the opioid epidemic .
