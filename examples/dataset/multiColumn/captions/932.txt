Many insurance companies employ a variety of different channels to offer and distribute their products . In addition to agents and brokers , these attached to a particular company or these working independently , a multitude of other institutions offer insurance products for purchase , such as affinity groups ( i.e . car dealers ) , banks , building societies and other outlets . Also , insurance products can be purchased directly from the insurance company , which is made easier than ever by the digital technology .
