The largest carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) emitter in the world is Asia Pacific , where there was 16.27 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide emitted in 2018 . China , alone , produced about 27 percent of the global territorial fossil fuel CO2 emissions . It is likely that top emitting countries will continue releasing more carbon dioxide every year . Yet , the level of emissions in high income countries have stabilized in comparison to the large emissions growth in low- and middle-income regions . However , based on per capita emissions , countries like the United States , Australia , and Canada are the largest CO2 emitters in the world . Carbon dioxide emissions Historically , global carbon dioxide emissions have risen exponentially since the pre-Industrial Revolution period . Carbon dioxide emissions are largely released through the combustion of fossil fuels have increased over the last decades . Under current energy trends , emissions are spread fairly evenly across oil , coal , and natural gas sources . This disruption of the global carbon cycle has a range of ecological , physical , and health impacts such as altered crop growth , extreme weather patterns , and sea-level rise .
