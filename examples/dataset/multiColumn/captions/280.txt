It is projected that electricity generated by most energy sources worldwide , with the exception of liquids , will increase in the coming years . Electricity from renewable sources is expected to experience the largest growth of up to 21.66 trillion kilowatt hours in 2050 , from almost 7 trillion kilowatt hours in 2018 . This projection sees increased consumption from all fuel sources , except for coal , where demand seems to have plateaued . Conventional sources like coal are increasingly being replaced by natural gas , renewables , and nuclear power . What is the fastest growing resource ? Renewable electricity generation has steadily increased over the past years and is expected to continue along this trend . Using the currently available renewable sources for electricity generation could supply a large majority of U.S. electricity generation in the near future . This supply would require increased electric system flexibility which could be provided through a variety of supply and demand options like flexible electricity generation from conventional sources , grid storage , and more responsible grids .
