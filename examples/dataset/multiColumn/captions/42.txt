This statistic shows the worldwide cement production , by major producing countries , from 2015 to 2019 . In 2019 , cement production in the United States amounted to some 89 million metric tons . Thus , the United States is among the global top three cement producers . Worldwide cement production China produces the most cement globally by a large margin , at an estimated 2.2 billion metric tons in 2019 , followed by India at 320 million metric tons in the same year . China currently produces over half of the world 's cement . Global cement production is expected to increase from 3.27 billion metric tons in 2010 to 4.83 billion metric tons in 2030 . In China , the cement production in 2018 amounted to some 2.17 million metric tons . Cement is used to bind material together and is categorized as either non-hydraulic or hydraulic . Hydraulic cements are composed of silicates and oxides that can set and harden even when exposed to water . Cement today is mostly used as stucco for buildings in wet climates , as mortar for applications near sea water , and as part of developments for strong concretes . Cement consumption in the United States decreased after the 2008 economic downturn , down to 71.5 million metric tons in 2009 . Since then however , consumption has gradually increased to an estimated 102 million metric tons in 2019 . In the U.S. , most cement is consumed between May and October . In Europe , CRH , a top cement manufacturer headquartered in Ireland , generated 30.21 billion euros in revenues in 2018 .
