In South Korea , approximately 72.5 percent of the population was between 15 and 64 years old in 2018 , while those above the age of 64 made up around 14 percent . The youngest generation made up an even smaller percentage than the elderly , but were the only group that did not increase in size over the last decade , partly due to a decrease in births since 2007 . Reasons for fewer children While it is not always the case that family sizes shrink when there are less births per woman , the fertility rate in South Korea is undisputably decreasing overall and less children are born . The reasons people cite for having fewer children vary greatly by gender and marital status in South Korea : For example , more married people than singles - and of those more married women than men - say that the difficulty of maintaining a work life balance is the largest concern for them . Meanwhile , men express more economic concerns about child support , and notably more singles nowadays say they feel no need to have children .
