In 2018 , almost half of India 's GDP was generated by the services sector , a slight and steady increase over the last 10 years . Among the leading services industries in the country are telecommunications , IT , and software . The IT factor The IT industry is a vital part of India 's economy , and in the fiscal year of 2016/2017 , it generated about 8 percent of India 's GDP alone – a slight decrease from previous years , when it made up about 10 percent of the country 's economy . Nevertheless , the IT industry is growing , as is evident by its quickly increasing revenue and employment figures . IT includes software development , consulting , software management , and online services , and business process management ( BPM ) . Employee migration Although employment figures in IT , and thus in the services sector , are on the rise , most of the Indian workforce is still employed in agriculture , however , the figures show a trend pointing towards a reversal of this distribution . For now , the majority of Indians still do not live in cities – where IT jobs are generated – but urbanization is on the rise as well .
