This statistic shows the results of a 2015 survey among adult Americans on the perception of people with tattoos . During the survey , 40 percent of respondents stated that they perceive people with tattoos as more rebellious than people without tattoos , while 6 percent stated they think tattooed people are less rebellious , and 54 percent did not see a difference between people with or without tattoos when it comes to being rebellious . Tattoos in American society As can be seen above , compared to people without tattoos , 40 percent of people find those with tattoos to be characteristically rebellious while only 16 percent of respondents find people with tattoos characteristically attractive . However , in most cases , people do not believe that having a tattoo can characterize someone as being spiritual , healthy or rebellious in addition to a number of other characteristics . This may be because tattoos are becoming more and more mainstream , with close to 30 percent of Americans now having one or more tattoos ; that means three out of every ten people . Furthermore , body ink is most common among Americans between the ages of 30 and 39 , a demographic where more than half have tattoos - i.e . one out of every two people . Another interesting fact is that slightly more women have tattoos than men . It the end , it appears rather difficult to characterize someone with a tattoo , especially when so many people now have them . However , at the same time , it is not always obvious to know who has one or not ; it turns out that a vast majority of tattooed Americans hide their tattoos in everyday life , with less than 20 percent having visible ones . However , this too may change as tattooed skin becomes more and more accepted . One indicator for this is the fact that Americans seem to be comfortable with tattoos in the workplace regarding a number of different professions - with one interesting exception : People appear less comfortable with tattoos on those who are presidential candidates .
