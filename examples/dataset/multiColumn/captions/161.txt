Soccer games in the German top division averaged around 44,000 spectators during the 2017/18 season , the highest average attendance of the biggest European soccer leagues . Top division games in England and Spain were ranked second and third respectively . The Bundesliga tops attendance table The top division of German soccer is known as the Bundesliga and has topped average attendance rankings outright across Europe since the 2004/05 season . There was an increase of around 2,500 spectators at Bundesliga games in the 2017/18 season compared to the season before and the league averaged around 5,500 more spectators than the English Premier League . Two German sides – Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich – were ranked in the top five for total number of spectators at soccer matches in Europe in 2017/18 . Borussia Dortmund had around 1.35 million people pass through the turnstiles , only Manchester United had more ; however , it is worth noting that teams in the English Premier League play two more home games per season due to a greater number of sides in their top division . Borussia Dortmund averaged 79,496 for each of their 17 home games in the Bundesliga in 2017/18 – the highest average attendance across all European soccer leagues.Standing in European soccer grounds It may come as a surprise that the English Premier League , which generates the largest revenue of the biggest European soccer leagues , does not top the attendance rankings . However , one advantage German soccer has over its English counterparts is that spectators remain free to stand in certain sections of stadiums , resulting in a greater number of people being allowed entry . Standing terraces were phased out in England following the Hillsborough disaster of 1989 and new regulations required all-seater stadiums to be introduced in the top two divisions of English soccer . Support for the return of safe standing areas in English stadiums has been growing in recent years – Tottenham Hotspur have installed rail seating at their new home stadium – but trials in the top two leagues have yet to be given the green light .
