In 2018 , Boeing 's worldwide revenue amounted to about 101 billion U.S. dollars . Leading aircraft manufacturers and suppliers Aircraft manufacturing can be divided into a commercial and a defense segment . While military aircraft manufacturing is likely to see a decline in revenue in the near future , commercial aircraft production is forecast to further expand its market size . Growth is projected to be largely driven by orders from commercial airlines that are keen to meet increased passenger travel demand . The rising number of commercial airline passengers is closely intertwined with the growing affluence in emerging markets . Although Japan 's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries has entered the market , there are essentially four major jet manufacturers - including Canada-based Bombardier and Brazil-based Embraer ( Empresa Brasileira de Aeron√°utica ) - albeit , for many years , the commercial jet aviation market has been a de facto duopoly between the European aircraft maker Airbus and the US aircraft builder Boeing . These two companies share between them about 65 percent of the world airliner fleet . The defense segment is expected to face military budget reductions in mature markets that will only partially be offset by increased military spending in the Middle East , Russia and China . The global leading defense manufacturers include Boeing , Lockheed Martin , EADS/Airbus and Northrop Grumman . In the area of engines and parts manufacturing , there is great competition between a number of companies , often conglomerates that are active in a variety of industries . CFM International and General Electric and the UK 's Rolls Royce Group , a company that should not be confused with the wholly BMW-owned automobile marque , are among the largest suppliers of engines for aircraft .
