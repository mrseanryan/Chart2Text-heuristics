The statistic shows a comparison of Apple Inc. 's , Google Inc. 's / Alphabet Inc. 's , and Microsoft Corp. 's revenues during the fiscal years from 2008 to 2018 . In the fiscal year 2018 , hardware-focused Apple 's 265.6 billion US dollar revenue was almost double the amount of online-based Google 's 136.2 billion U.S. dollars , with Microsoft generating 110.36 billion US dollars that same year . Whereas all of these companies have different market strengths , there are also overlaps and thus , competition . Apple and Google are direct competitors in the mobile phone market with their iOS and Android systems - in 2017 , Android accounted for 85.9 percent compared to Apple 's 14 percent ( and Microsoft 's miniscule percent ) of smartphone shipments . However , with over 51 billion U.S. dollars in iPhone revenues during the most recent fiscal quarter , Apple sure is no slouch when it comes to monetizing its products .
