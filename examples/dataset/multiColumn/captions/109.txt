The literacy rate measures the percentage of people aged 15 and above who are able to read and write . In 2017 , Pakistan 's total literacy rate was around 59 percent , with less than 47 percent of women being literate and more than 71 percent of men . Women in Pakistan need education In Pakistan , women 's education is in dire need of improvement , and so far , the number of illiterate women has not decreased - on the contrary , it has been going up for years . Although education for both genders is not prohibited in Pakistan , women are generally not as well educated as men . But it does n't stop there : Pakistan is one of the countries deemed worst for women in general when it comes to quality of life and safety . Economy and education Pakistan is a predominantly Muslim country with a low urbanization rate , meaning the majority of its population live in rural areas , where education is traditionally harder to come by than in cities . Pakistan is still a developing country , and typically , most of the inhabitants work in the primary sector , since Pakistan is rich in arable land . However , the tertiary sector generates the lion 's share of GDP . If the country wants to make the leap to being a developed nation , education and equality need to be higher on the list .
