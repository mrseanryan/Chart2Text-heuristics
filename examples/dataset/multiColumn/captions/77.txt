In 2018 , there were around 713 million male inhabitants and 682 million female inhabitants living in China , amounting to nearly 1.4 billion people in total . The population of the world 's most populous country remains growing , but growth has been slowing down and the total population size is forecast to peak around the end of the 2020s . Birth control in China From the beginning of the 1970s on , having many children was no longer encouraged in mainland China . The one-child policy was then introduced in 1979 to control the total size of the Chinese population . According to the one-child policy , a married couple was only allowed to have one child . With the time , modifications were added to the policy , for example parents living in rural areas were allowed to have a second child if the first was a daughter , and most ethnic minorities were excepted from the policy . Population ageing The birth control led to a decreasing birth rate in China and a more skewed gender ratio of new births due to boy preference . Since the negative economic and social effects of an aging population were more and more felt in China , the one-child policy was considered an obstacle for the country 's further economic development . Since 2014 , the one-child policy has been gradually relaxed and fully eliminated at the end of 2015 . However , many young Chinese people are not willing to have more children due to high costs of raising a child , especially in urban areas .
