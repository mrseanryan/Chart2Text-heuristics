Literacy in India has been increasing as more and more people receive a better education , but it is still far from all-encompassing . In 2018 , the degree of literacy in India was about 74.4 percent , with the majority of literate Indians being men . It is estimated that the global literacy rate for people aged 15 and above is about 86 percent . How to read a literacy rate In order to identify potential for intellectual and educational progress , the literacy rate of a country covers the level of education and skills acquired by a country 's inhabitants . Literacy is an important indicator of a country 's economic progress and the standard of living – it shows how many people have access to education . However , the standards to measure literacy can not be universally applied . Measures to identify and define illiterate and literate inhabitants vary from country to country : In some , illiteracy is equated with no schooling at all , for example . Writings on the wall Globally speaking , more men are able to read and write than women , and this disparity is also reflected in the literacy rate in India – with scarcity of schools and education in rural areas being one factor , and poverty another . Especially in rural areas , women and girls are often not given proper access to formal education , and even if they are , many drop out . Today , India is already being surpassed in this area by other emerging economies , like Brazil , China , and even by most other countries in the Asia-Pacific region . To catch up , India now has to offer more educational programs to its rural population , not only on how to read and write , but also on traditional gender roles and rights .
