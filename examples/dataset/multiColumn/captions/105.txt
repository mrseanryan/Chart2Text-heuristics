In the past decade , China has been shifting from the cheap labor driven economy to the more matured , service-oriented markets and industries . While the economy continues to grow , prices , cost of living , and wages keep on increasing as well . How do wages differ across the country ? China 's provinces and cities are divided into districts of different levels . Most provinces set different minimum wages for different districts depending on the cost of living and level of development . Usually , provincial capitals and major cities enjoy higher hourly wages than smaller towns and rural areas of the same province . In 2018 , the highest minimum hourly wages in China were in Beijing , Shanghai , and Tianjin municipalities with 24 , 21 , and 20.8 yuan respectively , whereas employees in Hunan and Yunnan provinces who received a minimum wage were paid the least – between 11.6 and 15 yuan per hour . Minimum monthly wages that year were the highest in Shanghai and the lowest in Chongqing . The average annual salary in urban China was around 74,300 yuan in 2017 . What are the prospects ? Regional governments in China must update their minimum wages at least every few years . Fujian , Hunan , Gansu , Guizhou , Tianjin , Qinghai , and Zhejiang – provinces and municipalities that have not adjusted minimum wages in the past two years – are likely to do so in 2019 . Along with economic development , increasing living standards , increasing prices and a shrinking labor force , overall minimum wages will likely continue growing in China .
