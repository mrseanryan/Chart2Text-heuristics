This statistic shows the shares of household income of quintiles in the United States from 1970 to 2018 . About 52 percent of the household income of private households in the U.S. were earned by the highest quintile in 2018 , which are the upper 20 percent of the workers . In contrast to that , in the same year , only 3.1 percent of the household income are earned by the lowest quintile . This relation between the quintiles illustrates the income inequality in the United States . Income inequality Income inequality is a big topic for public discussion in the United States . About 65 percent of U.S. Americans think that the gap between the rich and the poor has gotten larger in the past ten years . This impression is backed up by U.S. census data showing that the Gini-coefficient for income distribution in the United States has been increasing constantly over the past decades for individuals and households . The Gini coefficient for individual earnings of full-time , year round workers has increased between 1990 and 2018 from 0.36 to 0.42 , for example . This indicates an increase in concentration of income . In general , the Gini coefficient is calculated by looking at average income rates . A score of zero would reflect perfect income equality and a score of one indicates a society where one person would have all the money and all other people have nothing . Income distribution is also affected by region . The District of Columbia had the widest gap between rich and poor people in the United States with a Gini coefficient of 0.53 , as of 2018 . In global comparison , South Africa lead the ranking of the 20 countries with the biggest inequality in income distribution in 2017 . South Africa had a score of 63.4 points , based on the Gini coefficient . On the other hand , the Gini coefficient stood at 16.6 in Azerbaijan , indicating that income is widely spread among the population and not concentrated on a few rich individuals or families . Azerbaijan led the ranking of the 20 countries with the greatest income distribution equality in 2017 .
