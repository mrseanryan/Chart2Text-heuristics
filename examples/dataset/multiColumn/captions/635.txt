Global clinker capacity totaled and estimated 3.7 billion metric tons in 2019 , with China accounting for a vast majority of the world 's capacity at two billion metric tons . Likewise , China accounted for over half of the world 's cement production in recent years . Clinker in the United States The United States imported some 1.1 million metric tons of clinker for consumption in 2019 ; however , domestic production of clinker exceeded imports by a large volume . In recent years , updates to cement plants were undertaken in order to improve the plants ' ability to comply with emissions limits imposed by the National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants ( NESHAP ) for cement plants . However , under NESHAP , some cement kilns may also be shut down or used less and thus , decrease clinker production capacity . What is the difference between clinker and cement ? Cement is a binding material that hardens to connect building units like stones and brick ; it is most often used in construction . Clinker , on the other hand , acts primarily as a building block to produce cement . This is achieved through the grinding of clinker along with the addition of other active ingredients . Clinker is a granular substance with spherical pellets , whereas cement is a fine powdery substance . Cement is then further processed to make concrete and mortar and can be used for waterproofing , filling or sealing gaps , and even as decoration .
