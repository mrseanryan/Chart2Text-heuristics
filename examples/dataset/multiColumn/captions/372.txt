In the world of modern soccer , two giant names stand out - Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo . As the most talented and marketable players in the world , it is unsurprising that they top the list of highest-earning soccer players in 2019 . Messi just edged out his rival in the rankings , earning 92 million U.S. dollars in his salary and bonuses and a further 35 million U.S. dollars in endorsements . Messi 's European dominance The list of Lionel Messi 's personal and club achievements is almost endless . Since his debut back in 2004 , the diminuitive attacker has played over 600 matches for Barcelona and has scored at a rate of almost one goal every game . He has also won the Ballon d'Or/FIFA Ballon d'Or award – the most prestigious award in soccer – a total of five times . Messi has led FC Barcelona to four of their five total UEFA Champions League titles , and a staggering 10 domestic league titles . As of 2019 , FC Barcelona is one of the most valuable sports team brands in the world , valued at over four billion U.S. dollars . Ronaldo 's new challenge The Portuguese star , Cristiano Ronaldo , is the second highest paid soccer player in the world with 65 million U.S. dollars in salary and bonuses , and a further 44 million U.S. dollars in endorsements in 2019 . With 127 goals as of 2019 , the forward is the all-time top scorer in the UEFA Champions League since 1955 . Ronaldo spent the height of his career at Real Madrid , one of the most valuable European soccer teams . The Madrid-based team has the most titles in the UEFA Champions League , taking home the trophy four out of five times between 2013 and 2018 . However , having won everything imaginable at Real Madrid , Ronaldo sought a new challenge in 2018 and transferred to Juventus to try his luck in the Italian Serie A . It came as no surprise that his first season with the club was an overwhelming success as the Portuguese icon scored 21 goals in the league and won the inaugural Serie A Most Valuable Player award .
