The combined operating revenue of U.S. airlines has increased each year since 2015 , reaching an all-time high of just under 239.7 billion U.S. dollars in 2018 . Revenue streams Operating revenue is the revenue generated by a company from its primary business activities . In the case of most airlines , we can divide operating revenue into four main types : airfares , ancillary , cargo and other . Airfares is simply the revenue generated from the sale of flights , while cargo is any additional revenue generated from transporting freight or mail in addition to passengers . Ancillary airlines are the additional fees that are sometimes charged to passengers for extra services such as seat allocation , additional baggage , meals and access to an in-flight entertainment system or in-flight Wi-Fi . Ancillary revenue can comprise a significant portion of an airline 's total revenue , especially for low-cost carriers . Finally , other includes revenue from regular non-flight services such as frequent flyer programs or consumer credit cards offered by the airline . U.S. airlines In 2018 , the largest four passenger airlines in the U.S. accounted for just under two thirds of the total operating revenue generated by U.S. airlines . The three large full-service network carriers – American Airlines , Delta Air Lines and United – all reported a similar operating revenues in 2018 of between 40 and 45 billion U.S. dollars . Southwest Airlines – the fourth-largest U.S. airline and largest U.S. low-cost carrier – generated operating revenues around half that of the large network carriers .
