Economic liberalization on the Indian subcontinent Of all the factors and empirical data that give an insight into the shape of a national economy , there are n't as many indicators more telling than GDP . GDP is the total market value of all final goods and services that have been produced within a country in a given period of time , usually a year . Real GDP figures serve as an even more reliable tool in estimating in which direction a country 's economy may be heading , as they are adjusted for inflation and reflect real price developments . The decision of the newly independent Indian government to adopt a mixed economy , adopting both elements of both capitalist and socialist systems , resulted in huge inefficiencies borne out of the culture of interventionism that was a direct result of the lacklustre implementation of policy and failings within the system itself . The desire to move towards a Soviet style mass planning system failed to gain much momentum in the Indian case due to a number of hindrances , an unskilled workforce being one of many . When the government of the early 90 's saw the creation of small scale industry in large numbers due to the removal of price controls , the economy started to bounce back , but with the collapse of the Soviet Union - India 's main trading partner - the hampering effects of socialist policy on the economy were exposed and it underwent a large scale liberalization . By the turn of the 21st century , India was rapidly progressing towards a free-market economy . India 's development has continued and it now belongs to the BRIC group of fast developing economic powers .
