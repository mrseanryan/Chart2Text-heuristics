Today , the vast majority of the world uses what is known as the Gregorian calendar , Named after Pope Gregory XIII , who introduced it in 1582 . The Gregorian calendar replaced the Julian calendar , which had been the most used calendar in Europe until this point . The Gregorian calendar lasts for approximately 365.24 days ; this means that most years have 365 days , with one extra day being added every fourth year , unless the year is divisible by 100 but not 400 ( for example , the year 2000 was a leap year , whereas 2100 and 2200 will not be ) . Ancient Calendars Ancient American and Asian civilizations focused more on cycles of years ( such as the Chinese Zodiac ) , rather than recording centuries or millennia , therefore it is sometimes difficult to translate older calendars into modern terms . For example , the Mayan calendar did not develop in the same way as the Eurasian calendars , and can not be included with this data , as January 1st , 2020 is written as ' 13.0 .7.2 .7 ' _ . However , historians agree that by 1CE ( in the Gregorian calendar ) the majority of civilizations had realized that one year lasted for approximately 365.25 days , and most of the more modern calendars split each year into twelve months . The major differences between each calendar was the starting points of the year and months , with some beginning with the arrival of spring , therefore having no fixed date , and the addition of leap years varied across all civilizations . Revolutionary changes The most recent calendar included here is the French Revolutionary Calendar , which was an attempt to further abandon the 'Ancien RÃ©gime ' by decimalizing time and restructuring the calendar into twelve months of thirty days , with five or six holiday days left over . The calendar became official in 1793 , and was implemented across France and French-occupied areas of Europe , but it was then abandoned after just twelve years . In more recent times , there have been some campaigns to create a new , universal calendar , however the Gregorian calendar has proven again too difficult to replace , having itself become universally adopted , while the other surviving calendars are used mostly for ceremonial purposes .
