The statistic shows the ratio of government expenditure to the gross domestic product ( GDP ) in Greece from 2014 to 2018 , with projections up until 2024 . In 2018 , Greece 's government spending amounted to about 46.72 percent of the gross domestic product . Greece 's financial turmoil In 2011 , the ratio of government expenditure to GDP in Greece started to decrease significantly from 53.73 percent to 46.36 percent in 2014 . However , looking at Greece 's ratio compared to the other member states of the European Union , it shows that Greece - while still having a relatively high ratio - is not at the top of the list of countries with a high public ratio . Yet , Greece has a history of spending significantly more than it has been acquiring in government revenue . This unbalanced spending vs revenue situation is expected to change at some point between 2015 and 2016 . When spending more than it received , Greece covered its yearly deficits by borrowing money to make up the difference . The accumulation of these deficits resulted in Greece 's growing debt , which in 2014 amounted to a total of 317.31 billion euros , and with the economic crisis , the country has had difficulties in paying back its large debts . However , it appears as if Greece is beginning to keep government spending below revenue in the near future . In order to recover , the country also needs economic growth , and according to the IMF , GDP is expected to increase after 2015 and along with it , Greece will likely see positive growth rates .
