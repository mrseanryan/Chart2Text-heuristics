In 2019 , the average annual premium of car insurance in Italy amounted to roughly 350 euros . There were however large regional differences . For example , residents of Campania paid on average 529 euros a year , well above the national average . Other regions where the insurance premiums were higher than the national average were Tuscany and Lazio . Premiums for motorcycles were roughly a hundred euros cheaper . Car theft rates in the Italian provinces One of the factors that affect car insurance rates is the risk of theft . Naples , the regional capital of Campania , ranked fifth for the car theft rate in 2018 . The incidence of car theft was highest in southern Italian cities : all the cities in the top ten were located in the South . Furthermore , in this macro-region , one of the factors contributing to pricier car insurance premiums was the poor quality of the road network . Road accident rates Another factor Italian insurance companies take into consideration when setting their car insurance prices is the rate of traffic accidents . The number of car accidents with injuries in Italy decreased steadily over the past years . As of 2018 , the regions with the highest rate of fatal car accidents among young drivers were Liguria and Sardinia .
