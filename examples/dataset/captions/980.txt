During an September 2019 survey , it was found that 25 percent of teens in the United States used Instagram the most out of all social networks . This is hardly surprising , as U.S. teens rated Instagram among their favorite social network for the past few years . In spring 2019 , 35 percent of teenagers ranked the photo-sharing app as their most important social network . Teens and social media in the United States As evidenced by exasperated parents and teachers everywhere , social media is one of the most popular online activities among teenagers in the United States . Despite the near-constant social media usage , teens are usually reasonably aware of the time they spent online . During an April 2018 survey , 54 and 41 percent of responding teens stated that they spent too much time on their cellphone and on social media respectively . Due to constant interaction with other people online , teens come across a wide range of personalities . The most common personality types that teens come across social media are oversharers ( people who share too many personal details on social media ) and ranters ( people who rant and complain about things a lot ) . Social media and emotional well-being One of the key benefits of social media is that it can make teenagers feel less lonely and more confident and popular . However , with teens who have a low social-emotional well-being , social media can exacerbate pre-existing problems such as feeling left out or being excluded , as well as feeling bad about themselves when their posts did not get enough likes or comments . In the end , online socializing can make up for the lack of friends IRL ( in real life ) but it can also make things worse for teens who are already in emotional turmoil .
