This statistic represents the annual per capita water abstractions in selected countries in 2017 , or the latest year available . Canada reported water consumption levels of 883.5 cubic meters per capita . Water consumption per person About 70 percent of the planet 's surface is covered with water . Without it , life on earth would be impossible . Yet , less than one percent of the planet 's total water resources can be classified as accessible freshwater resources . Hence , although water is virtually abundant , as much as two-thirds of the global population may live in regions with limited access to freshwater resources by 2050 , as the world 's population is predicted to grow to reach 11.2 billion people by 2100 . While population levels are expected to increase at the fastest rate in emerging regions , water shortages will also be felt in industrialized countries - including the United States - where droughts and other weather-related catastrophes are set to become more frequent over the coming decades . By 2050 , industrial demand for water is expected to put enormous pressure on freshwater accessibility , thus shortening the amount of clean water available for agricultural and domestic uses . Since water is becoming increasingly scarce , the amount of water that is currently consumed per person in countries such as the United States can no longer be deemed acceptable . It is estimated that Americans use about 1,207 cubic meters of water every year . The U.S. is ranked among the leading water guzzlers worldwide . In order to prevent severe droughts in water-stressed areas today and in the future , a more efficient use of water is essential .
