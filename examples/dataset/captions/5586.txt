Between 2008 and 2018 , roughly 15 percent of the Belgium population was at risk of poverty , defined by Statistics Belgium as 60 percent of the average disposable income in the country . People with an income lower than this are considered poor . In 2018 , this definition matched nearly 16 percent of the Belgians . Women were especially vulnerable , as the share of women living under the poverty threshold was two percent points higher than the share of men . Severe material deprivation in Belgium In the last decade , the share of people suffering from severe material deprivation in Belgium has fortunately decreased , but as of 2018 still five percent of the population fit the EU definition , checking four out of these nine indicators : the inability to pay bills , the inability to properly heat the house , inability to deal with unexpected expenses , inability to eat meat , fish or chicken every two days , inability to go on a week-long holiday abroad , inability to afford a car , inability to afford a washer , inability to buy a television and inability to afford a telephone connection . For example , in 2018 6.3 percent of Belgians was unable to pay their bills in time . Nearly one quarter of Belgians can not afford a holiday Although the share of Belgians unable to afford a washing machine or telephone was relatively low ( 1.1 and 0.2 percent respectively ) , some other indicators proved to be a lot more problematic . In 2018 , just over 24 percent of Belgians was not able to pay unexpected expenses , and roughly the same amount of people could not afford to go on a week-long holiday either .
