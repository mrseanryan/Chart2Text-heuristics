Welfare in the U.S. Unemployment benefits first started in 1935 during the Great Depression as a part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt 's New Deal . The Social Security Act of 1935 ensured that Americans would not fall deeper into poverty . The United States was the only developed nation in the world at the time that did not offer any welfare benefits . This program created unemployment benefits , Medicare and Medicaid , and maternal and child welfare . The only major welfare program that the United States currently lacks is a paid maternity leave policy . Currently , the United States only offers 12 unpaid weeks of leave , under certain circumstances . However , the number of people without health insurance in the United States has greatly decreased since 2010 . Unemployment benefits Current unemployment benefits in the United States vary from state to state , because unemployment is funded by both the state and the federal government . The average duration of people collecting unemployment benefits in the United States has fluctuated since January 2019 , from as little as 10.87 weeks to as many as 19.3 weeks . The unemployment rate varies by ethnicity , gender , and education levels . For example , those aged 16 to 24 have faced the highest unemployment rates since 1990 . As of December 2019 , the Buffalo-Cheektowaga-Niagara Falls , New York metropolitan area had the highest unemployment rate in the United States .
