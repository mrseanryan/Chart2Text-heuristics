The cumulative subscriber churn rate of Spotify worldwide amounted to 19.8 percent in 2018 , up from 18.1 percent in the previous year . The source noted that this is partially due to promotional trials - whilst such trials draw in new subscribers , many of whom tend to convert , Spotify counts paid trialists in its subscriber numbers , meaning that those who do not convert then become churned subscribers .
