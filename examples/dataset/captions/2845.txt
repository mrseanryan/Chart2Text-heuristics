Annual and quarterly iPod unit sales The Apple iPod - additional information The launch of the iPod digital portable music device in 2001 was a breakthrough for Apple and a revolutionary move for the consumer electronics market . The company had not had widespread success for some time , but the iPod paved the way for other innovative and extremely successful products , such as the iPhone , launched in 2007 , and the iPad , released in 2010 . The first version of the iPod had a 5 GB hard drive , which could be used for storing music , but could also serve as an external data storage device . iPod sales were slow at first , due to the device 's need for a Macintosh computer and its iTunes software . However , the company continued to update the product , adding newer versions , such as the iPod Shuffle , iPod Nano and iPod Touch , with improved design , features and hard drive capacity . By its 2006 fiscal year , Apple iPod sales reached 40 million units worldwide . Sales peaked in Apple 's first financial quarter of 2009 , when over 22 million iPods were sold worldwide . At that point , iPod sales accounted for over 28 percent of Apple 's total revenue , but only five years later , this share had decreased to less than one percent . This decline in iPod revenue is in part due to the launch of the iPhone and other smartphones , which made having a music player redundant , due to the integrated music-playing features of a new generation of mobile phones . In 2009 , two years after the launch of the iPhone , the iPod was still the more successful of the two in regards to unit sales . Nevertheless , by the fourth quarter of 2014 , iPhone sales had increased to almost 40 million units , while only 2.5 million iPods were sold . Starting the following fiscal year , Apple stopped reporting iPod sales as a separate segment in its financial reports .
