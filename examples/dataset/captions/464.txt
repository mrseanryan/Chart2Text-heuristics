The statistic shows the global population by continent as of mid-2018 . In mid-2018 , approximately 4.54 billion people lived in Asia . World population and the most populous countries There are approximately 7.3 billion people living in the world today , a figure that shows a dramatic increase since the beginning of the Common Era . Since the 1970s , the global population has also more than doubled in size . It is estimated that the global population will reach and surpass 8 billion people by 2025 . When it comes to number of inhabitants , Asia ranks first by far . In mid-2016 , there were over 4.4 billion people living on the continent alone - more than half of the world 's total population . Similar to other global regions , a quarter of inhabitants in Asia are under 15 years of age . As of 2015 , only around 8 percent of the global population were 64 years old or older . That same year , the most populous nations in the world were China and India respectively , both located on the Asian continent , and each inhabiting more than three times the amount of people than the third-ranked United States . It is estimated that the total population in the most populous country , China , amounted to approximately 1.38 billion in 2016 . Not only is the total population in China increasing steadily , but the median age has also increased rapidly over the past six decades . Due to better health care and living conditions , it is estimated that the median age in China in 2015 was 37 years , i.e . half of the Chinese population was younger , while the other half was older than that . Interestingly enough , the top 20 countries with highest population growth rate in 2014 were mainly countries in Africa . This is due to the lack of contraception and a decrease in infant mortality . Both the population of Asia and Africa are expected to increase rapidly over the next 100 years . Africa 's population is estimated to surpass 4.3 billion by 2100 , while Asia 's inhabitants are likely to break the 4.8 billion mark that year . With these two clearly leading the race , the global population is increasing at an extremely rapid rate .
