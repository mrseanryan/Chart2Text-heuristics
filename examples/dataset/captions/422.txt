In 2019 , Ford Fiesta was the best selling car model at 77,833 units . Currently in its seventh generation , it was first sold in 1979 and had been popular with UK consumers from the beginning . Two years after its introduction on the market , the Ford Fiesta Mk1 had already reached the peak of the most sold supermini cars . As seen in this statistic , three of the leading ten car models were produced by Ford , with the car manufacturer pushing ahead of Volkswagen , the only other manufacturer with more than one entry . In terms of car sales in the UK , by far the most profitable month for Ford was March , when the it had sold 40,755 units . Supermini still most popular car type This statistic shows that smaller and more compact cars still proved the most successful with customers . Superminis remain the most common car type in the country , though its popularity has been declining since 2015 . Dual purpose and lower medium cars had seen the most significant growth in recent years , which is also reflected in the list of best selling cars â€“ three entries are compact SUVs , while only two other entries are classified as supermini cars . New car registrations in decline Despite an increase in new car registrations following the recession , figures have been decreasing again since 2017 . Uncertainty over Brexit and shortage in supply due to new emissions testing schemes were deemed responsible for this development . Forecasts suggest a continued decline , however the current political climate makes it difficult for the industry to offer conclusive predictions .
