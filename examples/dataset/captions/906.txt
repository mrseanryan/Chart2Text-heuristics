Unemployment in Iran is especially high among young people and women ; over 70 percent of the population 's close to 80 million inhabitants are of working age , increasing the overall demand of these inhabitants for work . Iran 's economy has also been in a recession , which has exacerbated the difficulties to meet the employment demands of its inhabitants . Although the economy is expected to recover slightly in 2014 , Iran 's GDP is expected to decrease and the real GDP growth rate is either negative or quite low . In times of a struggling economy , it is typically more difficult to create jobs and introduce people to the labor force . Because Iran 's economic activity still depends to a large extent on oil revenues , this also reduces the stability of the economy and employment . With a decreasing per capita GDP and a high inflation rate people are also more vulnerable to changes in income and employment , making the unemployment a pressing issue that the country will have to manage .
