The 163 murders recorded by the London Metropolitan Police in 2017/18 occurred following a 50 percent increase from the previous year , when there were 101 murders reported . Although 2018/19 showed a decline in homicides it was still higher than in any year between 2011/12 and 2016/17 , when the number of murders never exceeded 103 and was as low as 93 in 2014/15 . In the last five years , the worst quarter for murders was the second quarter of 2017 , when there were 51 murders , followed by the first quarter of 2018 when there were 46 . A national problem With a homicide rate of 18.4 per million people the London has second worst homicide rate in England and Wales , while the North West of England is only slightly higher at 18.7 . When looking at the numbers of homicides across the entire country , a similar pattern to London emerges . Between 2011/12 the number of homicides remained at a relatively low level before increasing sharply in 2016/17 , reaching a ten-year high of 736 in 2017/18 . Knives the weapon of choice In 2017/18 , 263 of the 736 homicides in England and Wales involved a knife or other sharp instrument ( 978830 ) . While guns are generally difficult to obtain in the United Kingdom , knives are far more prevalent and have become a major problem for the police , particularly in London . The number of knife crime offences in London rose from 9.7 thousand in 2015/16 to over 14.7 thousand by 2017/18 .
