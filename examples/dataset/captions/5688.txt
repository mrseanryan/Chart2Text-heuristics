In December 2018 , a house in Spain would cost around 1.699 thousand euros per square meter built . After a long period of time in which Spain 's real estate prices increased sharply , the market was hit by the global financial crisis of 2007 , making the Spanish property bubble collapse and damaging home value . House prices have picked up ever since in the Mediterranean country . According to the European Mortgage Federation ( EMF ) , real estate prices in Spain initiated a solid recovery in 2015 , reaching 78.7 house price index points in 2018 from a lowest point of 70.8 index points recorded in 2014 . Spain 's real estate market behind others The property market has made great progress , but it is still far off the rest of its European counterparts , and it is positioned , in fact , at the bottom of the European list of the EMF 's house price index , which is led by Sweden at 160.6 index points . In 2016 , 200 thousand euros could still buy a 119 square-meter home on average in Spain , whereas it would only allow for a 50 square-meter apartment in France . Renting becoming more popular in Spain As happens with many other countries , home rent and purchase prices will differ considerably dependent on the area . There are some indicators though that pointed to renting being slightly more favorable than buying a home in Spain as of 2015 , which might be the reason why more people are renting in recent years than before the financial crisis .
