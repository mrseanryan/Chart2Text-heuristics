Production of natural gas in the United States has been increasing for the past decade and amounted to 831.8 billion cubic meters in 2018 . An increase in production corresponded with rising demand for natural gas in the United States , particularly after the 2008 Recession . Natural gas becomes competitive Since the early 2000s , the price of coal had been going up , and increased more rapidly following the 2008 Recession , which affected the cost of crude oil to an even greater degree . When the price of crude oil peaked shortly after the financial crisis , consumption of petroleum decreased in the next year . Simultaneously , the cost of natural gas dramatically decreased , making it a stronger competitor with coal and petroleum . The rise of fracking Low-interest rates during the Recession led to new investments in new techniques to obtain natural gas , such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing , that may be controversial due to health and environmental impacts . Often obtained through fracking , shale gas has become a common form of natural gas , and shale gas production in the United States has increased dramatically since the financial crisis .
