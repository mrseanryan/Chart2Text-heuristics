Due to Venezuela currently battling hyperinflation , the average inflation rate in Venezuela amounted to about 438.12 percent in 2017 compared to the previous year . After that year , there are only estimates to pinpoint inflation in the country , as Venezuela 's economy is collapsing . What is hyperinflation ? In short , hyperinflation is a very high inflation rate that accelerates quickly . It can be caused by a government printing huge amounts of new money to pay for its expenses . The subsequent rapid increase of prices causes the country 's currency to lose value and shortages in goods to occur . People then typically start hoarding goods , which become even more scarce and expensive , money becomes worthless , financial institutions go bankrupt , and eventually , the country 's economy collapses . The Venezuelan descent into hyperinflation In Venezuela , the economic catastrophe began with government price controls and plummeting oil prices , which caused state-run oil companies to go bankrupt . The government then starting printing new money to cope , thus prices rose rapidly , unemployment increased , and GDP collapsed . Today , many Venezuelans are emigrating to find work and supplies elsewhere , and population growth is at a decade-low . Current president Nicol√°s Maduro does not seem inclined to steer away from his course of price controls and economic mismanagement , so the standard of living in the country is not expected to improve significantly anytime soon .
