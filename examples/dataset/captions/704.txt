Pakistan 's gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth was 5.53 percent in 2018 after adjusting for inflation . However , projections for the coming years predict that GDP will grow at a rate around 5 percent in the coming years . GDP in developing nations Gross domestic product measures value of all final goods and services produced within a country 's borders during a certain period of time . In developing countries , GDP should rise more quickly due to `` catch-up growth '' . In many developing nations , employment is shifted from agriculture to the services sector ; simply shifting workers from one sector to more productive sectors increases the income of both the workers and their employers , increasing GDP . This raises GDP per capita ( 383750 ) , which gives a general idea of the level of development . International setting Due to historic tensions , Pakistan neither imports nor exports a significant amount from its neighbor India , favoring China instead . Its other neighbors , Afghanistan and Iran , are not as economically stable at the moment . Pakistan 's own GDP is also not in the best shape and is expected to drop during 2019 , however , Pakistan stands to benefit from China 's Belt and Road Initiative , which would revive the trading routes that made Pakistan wealthy in past centuries . If this comes to fruition , the GDP for Pakistan is sure to increase .
