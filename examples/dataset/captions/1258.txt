Dell 's market share of PC shipments worldwide remained above 16 % for the entire year of 2019 , making Dell the number three PC vendor in the world following Lenovo ( 25 % ) and Hewlett Packard ( 23 % ) . Of the total global personal computer unit shipments of around 261 million in 2018 , Dell was responsible for almost 44 million . Top vendors increase share in shrinking market Since reaching a high of more than 360 million units shipped in 2011 , the PC market has declined every year since then and is forecast to decline even further . However , major vendors like Dell , Lenovo , and HP have managed to keep their unit sales steady and managed to increase their market share in this period of declining shipments . One reason for declining shipments was the shortage of Intel 's central processing units ( CPUs ) , which caused difficulties for vendors ' supply chains and inventories . The top three vendors succeeded in recovering by absorbing the costs by quickly switching to alternative component retailers , while smaller competitors have struggled . This enabled the leading vendors to stay competitive in terms of sales price amid these growing costs . Shifting to the cloud based world The market is also experiencing a long-term fundamental shift from on-premise hardware to cloud solutions . As a response , Dell Technologies has advanced efforts in cloud infrastructure solutions to simplify hybrid cloud settings through its company VMware , a cloud computing and software virtualization company currently worth 65 billion U.S. dollars .
