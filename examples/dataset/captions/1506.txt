In 2017 , some 32 percent of respondents stated they will probably have sex on Valentine 's Day that year , while almost half of all respondents stated they probably wo n't . Is romance really dead ? Valentine 's Day is generally considered the most romantic day of the year , which people use to give flowers and tokens of appreciation to loved ones . About half of the American population celebrate Valentine 's Day , but this fact does not infer that the same share of the population is taken or in love ; in fact , a certain share of respondents rather bought Valentine 's presents for their pets last year rather than a significant other , and another significant share of respondents spent the day alone , with colleagues , friends , or with family , rather than with a spouse or a partner . Romance is lucrative Although the enthusiasm for Valentine 's Day in the U.S. might be lacking , consumption and spending ( 806027 ) for this occasion is not : Valentine 's Day sales in the United States ( 285028 ) have steadily increased over the last decade , likely cracking the 20 billion dollar mark in 2019 , with gifting experiences and events gaining in popularity ( 285034 ) â€“ but staples like jewelry and flowers are still going strong .
