This statistic shows the average inflation rate in Chile from 1984 to 2018 , with projections up until 2024 . In 2018 , the average inflation rate in Chile had amounted to about 2.32 percent compared to the previous year . Chile 's slowing economy The inflation rate in Chile has fluctuated from a low of 1.41 percent in 2010 to a high of 4.39 percent as of 2014 . Despite the central bank having issued a target inflation rate of 3 percent , it was not reached in 2014 , 2015 or 2016 , defying expectations . Rising inflation is said to be affected by a weakening peso , combined with a relatively weak economy . While these inflation rates are not nearly comparable to some of the highest inflation rates around the world , slow growth and a lack of consumer and business confidence remain an underlying concern in Chile . Annual economic growth remains low at around two percent per year , fueling this concern . Further , export values are also in a slump as are those for imports , and this slow growth has had a significant effect on GDP growth per capita : In 2013 , GDP per capita was around 15,713 U.S. dollars per capita , and in 2016 it is expected to drop by almost a fifth . In response , this year Chile has introduced a number of measures to help boost the economy , and 2016 is supposed to be the `` Year of Productivity '' with hopes of increasing trade and investment to raise growth and wages .
