As of April 2019 , it was estimated that MoviePass had just 225 thousand subscribers in the United States , a significant drop from the three million recorded in June 2018 . MoviePass is no stranger to media attention , but after the recent claims from a source that they had obtained internal data about MoviePass 's floundering subscriber base , the company is once again in the spotlight . What is MoviePass ? MoviePass is a subscription-based movie ticketing service , designed to allow subscribers to buy a select amount of movie tickets each month for a single fee . MoviePass has been controversial since its inception , with multiple app issues , price changes and major chains expressing concerns about MoviePass 's business model . Despite a sudden increase in its subscriber base in 2018 , MoviePass has never been especially popular with potential customers . A study showed that most respondents had never subscribed to MoviePass and a large amount had never heard of the service . Among the few responding adults who did subscribe , most were under the age of 45 , with only very small percentages of older generations saying that they had a subscription .
