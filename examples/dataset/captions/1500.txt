The population density in France was 122.34 people per square kilometer ( 47.24 per square mile ) in 2018 . This number has been slowly increasing for the past ten years . Higher population density is associated with urbanization , but not necessarily economic growth . Comparative densities France 's population density is higher than the European average . In fact , it is higher than any region except Asia , as well as the total world population density . This is likely due to the number of large cities in France . The country has one of the largest urban populations in the world . This shapes the French economic and social landscapes ; the cities become more expensive , but they also bring more economic opportunities . These opportunites attract people both from the French countryside and other countries who hope to benefit from such jobs . A tale of two countries For those who can afford it , Paris can be a cosmopolitan paradise . However , with the average price of a rental apartment twice that of most other French cities , few can afford to live in the richest parts of the city . This stark difference in costs implies that average annual wages should have a similar difference between cities . While this is not a perfectly even cause and effect , it gives some explanation for the increasing population density of France .
