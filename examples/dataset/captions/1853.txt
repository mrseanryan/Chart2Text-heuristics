This statistic illustrates a the number of housing transactions in the United Kingdom ( UK ) forecasted from 2018 to 2022 . According to the figures as of 2018 , it can be seen that the number of housing transactions was forecasted to increase from approximately 1.18 million in 2018 to a total of 1.3 million by the year 2022 . These figures would lead to an average of 1.21 million transactions per annum between the years 2018 and 2022 . This increase in number of housing transactions can be somewhat related to the expected forecasted growth in housing completions in the United Kingdom ( UK ) . It could be speculated that the larger number of housing completions could in turn lead to the higher availability and choice of property units offered for purchase , and as such could lead to lowering of house prices . This consequently could have an effect on the potential increase in the total number of housing transactions conducted on the British market .
