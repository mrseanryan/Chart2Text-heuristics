U.S. motorcycle registrations by state In 2016 , California reported the highest amount of registered private and commercial motorcycles in the country , followed by Florida , Ohio , Pennsylvania and New York ( all of them with over 390,000 registrations that year ) . Not only is California the U.S. state with the highest number of motorcycles , but it is also the most populous state in the U.S. overall , representing close to 12 percent of the country 's total population . At the bottom of the ranking are Mississippi , Delaware and the District of Colombia with less than 29,000 registrations , as well as less populous states , including Wyoming , and Delaware . Despite the efforts made by each state to provide accurate vehicle ( in this case , motorcycle ) registration data , occurrences that would lead to a duplication –re-registration stands as one of the main reasons for this– of registrations are stated to be inevitable . The information is forwarded to the Federal Highway Administration ( FHWA ) , who compiles it into an annual series of statistics relevant to the study of highway systems throughout the country .
