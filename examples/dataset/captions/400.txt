Manchester City was the most represented team at the World Cup in 2018 , with 16 of its players participating . One of those players , Benjamin Mendy , came back with a World Cup winners ' medal as France took home the trophy after beating Croatia 4 - 2 in the final . Premier League players at the World CupThe Premier League sent the largest contingent of players to the 2018 World Cup , with 108 of the footballers at the tournament plying their trade in the English top division . In fact , only one side from the 2017/18 Premier League did not have representation at the tournament â€“ AFC Bournemouth . England also boasted the leading goal-scorer at the 2018 World Cup as England captain and Tottenham Hotspur star , Harry Kane , took home the award after hitting the back of the net six times during the tournament in Russia . However , he still has some way to go to match the 16 goals scored by all-time leading World Cup goal scorer , Miroslav Klose.Clubs reluctant to part with their stars The World Cup is the pinnacle of any footballer 's career , but with clubs relying on their best players to be at the top of their game for the domestic season , it is no wonder that they are reluctant to see their superstars go through the rigors of a World Cup campaign . As a result , FIFA introduced the so-called World Cup Benefits Program to compensate domestic leagues and clubs for the risk of injury to players during the tournament . For the 2018 World Cup , FIFA paid out over 27 million euros to the English domestic leagues alone , as well as almost 15 million euros to the Spanish leagues . Having sent some of their prized assets to the World Cup , including Cristiano Ronaldo and Luka Modric , Real Madrid received the highest amount of compensation out of any domestic teams for their players featuring at the 2018 World Cup .
