This statistic represents the leading countries in biofuel production in 2018 . In Germany , production reached around 3.4 million metric tons of oil equivalent that year . That means , Germany is among the global top three countries in biofuel production . The volume of biodiesel production in the United States can be found here . Biofuel production in the U.S.Biofuels are characterized by fuels that obtain their energy through the process of biological carbon fixation . These hydrocarbons are made by or from living organisms in a relatively short period of time - in comparison to the formation of fossil fuels which requires millions of years . The United States was by far one of the largest producers of biofuel in the world in 2018 , accounting for 39.9 percent of global biofuel production . The country produced 35 million metric tons of oil equivalents in this year , while Brazil produced 22.4 million metric tons of oil equivalents . Global biofuel production has gradually increased from 9.2 million metric tons of oil equivalents in 2000 to 95.37 million metric tons of oil equivalents in 2018 . Biofuels are commonly used as part of mixtures with fossil fuel sources or as additives . One of the largest consumers of biofuels in the U.S. is the national army . Many vehicles can be fueled using blends containing up to 10 percent ethanol . In the beginning of the 20th century , many Ford T models were fueled with ethanol . Biofuels can also be generated through the consumption or conversion of biomass material . This conversion can occur thermally , chemically , or biochemically . Biomass consumption in the United States totaled 5,196 trillion British thermal units in 2018 .
