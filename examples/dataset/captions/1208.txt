This statistic shows the leading ten countries worldwide based on uranium consumption in 2017 . In that year , the United States was the largest uranium consumer worldwide , using a total of almost 19,000 metric tons of uranium . Uranium consumption worldwide Uranium is a heavy metal that occurs in many rocks as well as in sea water . Its high density allows it to be used in the keels of yachts as well as for radiation shielding . However , it is most commonly known for its use as a source of concentrated energy in nuclear power plants . Under specialized nuclear reactors , various radioisotopes of uranium can be produced to use in medicine , food preservation , and industrial agriculture . For example , radioactive chemical tracers can be used in the diagnosis of the human body . Uranium is generally extracted through open-pit and underground mines , however , with advances in technology , alternative methods such as in-situ leach mining have become more prominent . Uranium consumption is the highest in the United States , France , and China , as of 2017 . However , Kazakhstan and Canada are among the top producers of uranium with around 23,400 metric tons and 13,100 metric tons produced in 2017 , respectively . In fact , the United States receives much of its uranium from Canada . Australia has some of the largest known recoverable uranium resources in the world with some 1.17 million metric tons as of 2014 . Areva , headquartered in Paris , is one of the largest uranium producers in the world , producing some 10,500 metric tons in 2015 . Areva is the only company that has established itself in all industrial aspects of nuclear energy including mining , chemistry , engineering , nuclear reactors , and recycling .
