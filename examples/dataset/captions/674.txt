This statistic shows the unemployment rate in Russia from 1999 to 2019 . In 2019 , the unemployment rate in Russia ranged at approximately 4.55 percent . Unemployment An unemployed person is defined as someone who is out of work and usually looking for work actively . Unemployment in a country is measured using the unemployment rate , which is an index calculated by dividing the number of workers out of work by the total workforce of a country , and then multiplying that figure by 100 . The labor force is made up of the people who are old enough and physically fit enough to work . The unemployment rate is an important economic factor , but economists do not always agree on what exactly causes unemployment . They do agree , however , that unemployment typically rises during bad times for the economy , i.e . recessions . As for other important economic factors , Russia 's inflation rate has been decreasing for a few years now , while its real ( inflation-adjusted ) gross domestic product is still recovering from a steep decline in 2009 . As most other economies , Russia 's economy focuses mostly on the Services and Industry sector , while the Agriculture sector plays little to no role when it comes to gross domestic product generation . Consequently , the vast majority of the labor force works in those two sectors . However , Russia is among the top wheat exporters worldwide , ranking third after the United States and Canada .
