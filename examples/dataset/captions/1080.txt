Successful Kickstarter campaigns - additional information As of 2015 , Kickstarter is one of the largest crowdfunding platforms in the world , having reportedly received more than 1.6 billion U.S. dollars in pledges from 8.9 million individuals since its 2009 launch . According to industry experts , global crowdfunding campaigns have raised a total of 16.2 billion U.S. dollars in 2014 , a 167 percent growth from the previous year 's 6.1 billion . In 2015 , the industry is expected to reach 34.4 billion U.S. dollars in pledges from all over the world . However , crowdfunding , financing of a project through small donations from a great number of individuals , is not in itself a new idea and has been used in history before . A notable example is the completion of the Statue of Liberty , which was backed by more than 120,000 contributors , most of whom gave less than a dollar , following a campaign initiated by famed journalist Joseph Pulitzer . While other websites , such as GoFundMe , allow people to raise money for anything from graduations to medical bills , trips or charity , Kickstarter focuses on mainly creative projects , from craft ideas to music albums or technological innovations . As of June 2015 , the most popular category of projects featured on the platform is games , with some 360 million U.S. dollars pledged , followed by technology , design , film & video , and music . As of April 2015 , some 38 percent of the campaigns posted on Kickstarter have reached or even exceeded their funding goal . The most successful Kickstarter campaign of all time is the one supporting Pebble Time , a smartwatch developed by Pebble Technology Corporation , which had an initial fundraising target of 100 thousand U.S. dollars , but received pledges worth over 10 million U.S. dollars from almost 70 thousand backers . It is also the campaign fastest to reach pledges worth 1 million U.S. dollars , in a record 30 minutes . The popular smartwatch went into production and was released in 2013 , selling its one millionth unit in December 2014 .
