The city of Miami has hosted the most Super Bowls in the history of the NFL . The Florida city has hosted the showpiece event on eleven occasions , most recently when it welcomed fans from around the world at the Super Bowl in 2020 . The history of the Super Bowl The first four editions of the Super Bowl , contested from 1967 to 1970 , were played between the champions of the American Football League ( AFL ) and the National Football League ( NFL ) . The rival leagues merged ahead of the 1970 season , making Super Bowl V in 1971 the first championship game in the modern era of the NFL – Super Bowl LIV in 2020 will be the 50th as a united league . The Super Bowl trophy was renamed the Vince Lombardi Trophy ahead of Super Bowl V in honor of the former Green Bay Packers coach who passed away at the start of that season – Lombardi led the Packers to two of their four Super Bowl wins . A century of NFL football The NFL celebrated a landmark occasion during the 2019 season : it is the 100th season of the league . The inaugural season of the American Professional Football Association – later renamed the NFL – took place in 1920 , and two of the founding teams remain to this day : the Chicago Cardinals ( now known as the Arizona Cardinals ) and the Decatur Staleys ( now Chicago Bears ) . It would be fitting if the oldest rivalry in the NFL contested the Super Bowl in 2020 , adding to their combined three Super Bowl appearances .
