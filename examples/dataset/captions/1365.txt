This statistic shows the Retail Price Index ( RPI ) in the United Kingdom ( UK ) from 2000 to 2018 . During this period , the RPI rose to 281.6 points . With the exception of 2009 - which the annual percentage change to RPI shows as a decrease - there was an increase in the index every year . The UK Retail Price Index of services shows that there was also steady growth throughout this period , although this trend was not mirrored by the UK Retail Price Index of goods whereby there was some initial fluctuation which was then followed by substantial annual increases . Fluctuation can also be found in monthly RPI , whereby RPI experienced a decline in each January , before gradually increasing throughout the remainder of the year . A very similar trend is found in the monthly Retail Price Index Jevons ( RPIJ ) . In addition , an RPI inflation forecast is also accessible .
