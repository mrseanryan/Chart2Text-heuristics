In 2018 , around 155.76 million people were employed in the United States . For 2020 , an increase by almost 2 million employed people is expected . Willing but unable The American unemployment rate has seen its ups and downs over the last decades ; recovery from an alarming increase in unemployment during the financial crisis in 2009 and the Great Recession fueled by job loss and bankruptcies could only recently be declared , after the Obama administration focused on job creation from 2010 on . Since then , unemployment has been on a downward trend while employment figures are steadily increasing . The Great Inherited Recession The financial crisis happened under President Bush , when the housing market bubble in the United States burst and caused a global banking crisis . Millions of Americans lost their homes and their jobs and thus their source of income . Since the economy usually takes a few years to react to and recover from such a crisis , the United States suffered the consequences for several years . Key economic indicators , like the unemployment rate or the inflation rate , did not recover fully until 2016 , meaning that remnants of the crisis were inherited by the next sitting U.S. President , Barack Obama . In the same vein , current U.S. President , Donald Trump , now benefits from the Obama job creation initiative , since unemployment today is historically low .
