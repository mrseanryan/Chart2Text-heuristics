The statistic depicts Mexico 's real gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth rate from 2014 to 2018 , with projections up until 2024 . GDP refers to the total market value of all goods and services that are produced within a country per year . It is an important indicator of the economic strength of a country . Real GDP is adjusted for price changes and is therefore regarded as a key indicator for economic growth . In 2018 , Mexico 's real GDP grew by about 2 percent compared to the previous year . Mexico 's economy Mexico , having not been dramatically affected by the 2002 South American crisis , has one of the strongest economies in the Americas behind the United States and Canada . By improving its macroeconomic rules and regulations , Mexico improved on many aspects of its economy , most notably inflation . Several goals that the government wanted accomplish were the improvement of infrastructure around the country as well as newer tax laws that would allow for higher income equality . Mexico is generally an export-oriented country , with the majority of export goods consisting of electronics , automobiles and agricultural goods . Exports over the past decade have seen continuous growth , with the exception of 2009 . This increase in exports is largely due to an increasing number of free trade agreements with international countries , which essentially eliminate tariffs between member countries . However , Mexico imports more than they export , having recorded an annual trade deficit over the past decade . While most economics label this as a negative aspect , other economics believe that trade deficits are associated with positive economic developments .
