Video gaming giant , Electronic Arts , generated net revenue of over one billion U.S. dollars in its 2019 fiscal year . While this marks a slight decrease on the revenue from the previous year , it still depicts a positive overall trend considering the company recorded net losses between 2008 and 2011 . EA revenue Founded in 1982 , EA was one of the first companies to explore the idea of home computer games and , in the ensuing decades , has been responsible for legendary game franchises such as FIFA , Madden NFL , and The Sims . The company generated net revenue of 4.95 billion U.S. dollars in 2019 , over two million U.S. dollars of which was generated in North America . Given that EA is known for its wide range of console games , it is no surprise that the company generates most of its revenue from console gaming â€“ approximately 3.33 billion U.S. dollars of revenue was generated in this segment in 2019 , whilst all of the other segments generated less than 1.7 billion U.S. dollars combined . However , in the age of mobile gaming where people want to play games wherever and whenever , EA has seen its mobile revenue more than double since 2014 . EA 's future Despite its reputation as a gaming giant , EA can not afford to rest on its laurels with so many other players entering the gaming world . The company spent 702 million U.S. dollars on marketing and sales expenditures in 2019 , marking a slight increase on the previous year 's figure . With future releases including the new editions of the FIFA and Madden series , as well as a new Star Wars game emerging in late 2019 , the next few years look to be vital in determining EA 's future success .
