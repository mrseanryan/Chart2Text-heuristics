How many people play Fortnite ? Having burst onto the scene in 2017 , Fortnite has since become a worldwide phenomenon , amassing almost 250 million players across the globe as of March 2019 . How did Fortnite become so big ? The reasons why Fortnite has become such a global hit are clear to see . Not only is the game free , but it is also available on most gaming platforms . On top of this , the Battle Royale-style , in which up to 100 players fight it out at one time , mean that the re-playability of the game is infinite â€“ each game is unique . The cartoon style of the game unsurprisingly lends itself more to the younger audience , with almost two-thirds of Fortnite 's players aged between 18 and 24 . It also seems that it is not just the casual gamers that are attracted to this game as over 20 percent of Fortnite fans admitted to devoting over 16 hours to the game per week . Battle for Battle Royale supremacy With the rise of games such as Fortnite , the Battle Royale game mode has never been bigger . Revenue in the Battle Royale premium console segment amounted to 2.7 billion U.S. dollars in 2018 and was estimated to more than double to 6.9 billion U.S. dollars in 2019 . While Fortnite is certainly staking its claim as the king of the Battle Royale games , it faces stiff competition from PlayerUnknown 's Battlegrounds which , unlike Fortnite , is available on Steam . PUBG peaked at almost 3.24 million concurrent players on Steam at the beginning on 2018 and is still regularly peaking at over one million concurrent players . It seems that game developers are looking to cash in on this ever-growing market , so could new games such as Apex Legends also pose a threat to Fortnite 's supremacy ?
