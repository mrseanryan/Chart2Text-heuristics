Currency exchange rates â€“ additional information A currency exchange rate expresses how much a given currency is worth in another currency . Every country has its own currency , which is used locally as a means of payment for goods and services . An exception is the euro zone , a coalition of European countries , where the euro is the common currency used . The euro was first introduced on the financial markets on January 1st , 1999 and it replaced the domestic currencies of the eleven countries which initially participated in the creation of the euro zone . Maintaining the stability of a currency is one of the most relevant tasks of a government . Significant fluctuations of a currency can deteriorate the value of international trade , capital flows , interest rates , business revenues ( if part of the company operations are carried out abroad ) , foreign-currency mortgages or returns and investments . One of the most common ways of measuring the change in the value of currency is comparing its purchase parity in different time periods . The indicator used for this purpose is called the Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) , which reflects the price of goods and services in a household . If , within one year , the price of the goods and services basket changes from 1,000 U.S. dollars to 1,050 U.S. dollars , it means that the inflation rate was equal to five percent and that the purchase power of the U.S. dollar decreased during this period .
