CPI forecast Although the Retail Price Index is a commonly utilized inflation indicator , the UK also uses a newer method of calculating inflation , the Consumer Price Index .

By 2024 for example , the CPI inflation rate is expected to be two percent , compared with the RPI forecast of 4.2 percent . Which one is correct ? The CPI is used as the official inflation statistic by the UK government in most cases , but the RPI is still used in certain instances . Increases in rail fares are calculated using the RPI for example , while increase in pension payments are calculated using CPI .
