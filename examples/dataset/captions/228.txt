Spotify closely followed , with a similarly impressive 47.7 million monthly users . What is a music streaming service ? Music streaming services provide their users with a database compiled of songs , playlists , albums and videos , where content can be accessed online , downloaded , shared , bookmarked and organized . The music streaming business is huge , and has sometimes been lauded as the savior of the music industry . The biggest two services are in constant competition for the monopoly of the market . Apple Music was launched in 2015 , whereas Spotify has been around since 2008 . Other popular streaming services include Deezer , SoundCloud and iHeartRadio . Do artists make a lot of money from streaming services ? In short , unfortunately not . Both Apple Music and Spotify have been frequently criticized for the tiny royalty payments they offer artists . Particularly for emerging talent , streaming services are far from a lucrative source of income . Bigger , established stars like Taylor Swift are more likely to regularly make a good amount of money this way . But either way , a track needs to go viral or be streamed several million times before it earns any real cash .
