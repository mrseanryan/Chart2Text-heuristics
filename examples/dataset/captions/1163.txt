Canada 's carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel and cement production reached about 568 million metric tons in 2018 , compared to 494 million metric tons in 1995 . A large percentage of global greenhouse gas emissions ( GHG ) are derived from the production and consumption of energy . In Canada , energy-related emissions account for an even higher share of total emissions due to extreme temperatures , large land area , and dispersed populations . In terms of electricity , increased generation from renewable sources has also helped to decrease energy-related emissions , however , fossil fuels still constitute the majority of Canada 's primary energy supply . Which province is the largest GHG emitter ? Alberta is one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gas emissions in Canada . Together the top five provincial emitters , including Alberta , Ontario , Quebec , Saskatchewan , and British Columbia , accounted for over 91 percent of the country 's emissions . The oil production in Alberta contributes to the province 's high emissions , especially under periods of increased oil sands production . However , technological and efficiency improvements have helped reduce the oil sands emissions per barrel .
