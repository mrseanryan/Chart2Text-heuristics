Messaging app LINE is Japan 's most popular online communication tool , peaking at approximately 83 million monthly actives users in Japan during the fourth quarter of 2019 . LINE 's main target group are young adults aged 15 to 34 years , representing more than 50 percent of the company 's Japanese user base in 2018 . The rise of LINE in Japan The success story of messaging service LINE , a Japanese subsidiary of South Korean internet powerhouse Naver , started back in 2011 during the Great East Japan Earthquake . While most conventional communication channels had broken down due to power failures , official sources turned to online options for communicating news and confirming the safety of the country 's residents . The app was released for public use later that year , appealing greatly to Japanese consumers due to its unique and customizable design , allowing both private and business usage simultaneously . LINE 's annual revenue rose from under seven billion Japanese yen in fiscal year 2012 to over 227 billion yen in fiscal year 2019 , emphasizing the company 's major success since its first launch less than ten years earlier . Social media usage in Japan Compared to its neighboring countries , the Japanese market had a relatively low social network penetration rate of only 65 percent as of January 2020 , being noticeably outpaced by Taiwan with 88 percent and South Korea with 87 percent audience reach . While globally leading networks do get their fair share of popularity within the Japanese social media market , in 2018 , LINE 's audience reach was almost twice as high as those of internationally successful apps such as Twitter or Instagram .
