More people are using Facebook in Europe than ever before , with the company recording 385 million monthly active users ( MAUs ) in the second quarter of 2019 . That represents a growth of six million active users from the previous quarter , and 121 million users from the fourth quarter of 2012 . It also marks the third consecutive period of growth , after the company lost millions of MAU at the same time news of the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke . Monthly active users worldwide In the fourth quarter of 2008 Facebook provided a service for just 100 million active users . As of the fourth quarter of 2013 , that number had risen to an astounding 2.32 billion MAUs . The number of MAUs has never taken a backward step during that time . Growth outside of Europe and North America Facebook continues to focus on regions outside of Europe and North America , and the reward of this effort can be seen in areas such as the Asia Pacific Region , where the company has seen significant gains in terms of growing the active user base . Facebook just broke the 600 million daily active user ( DAU ) barrier in the first quarter of 2019 , an improvement on the quarter before .
