This was partly due to the heavy taxation of alcoholic beverages in Singapore . Even so , health officials were concerned about a rise in unhealthy drinking habits among the young . Too expensive to get drunk ? Averaging at around 24 U.S. dollars for a bottle of table wine and eight U.S. dollars for a pint of beer , Singapore is one of the most expensive cities worldwide for consuming alcohol . It was probably unsurprising that the country had one of the lowest alcohol consumption rates in Asia-Pacific . Drinking your money 's worth Despite the high prices , many Singaporeans were still able to afford alcoholic beverages , and bars and pubs frequently offer happy hour and all-you-can-drink specials , or `` liquid buffets '' , to attract patrons . Wednesdays in Singapore are synonymous with Ladies ' Night , where bars all over the city offer special deals to attract female customers , mostly in the form of free-flow drinks . To put it in perspective , Singaporean females consume around three times less alcohol than their male counterparts . Such deals , however , can be seen to encourage binge drinking , especially among the younger drinkers , for whom alcohol would be an expensive indulgence .
