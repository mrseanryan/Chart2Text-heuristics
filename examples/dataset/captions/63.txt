In 2019 , South Sudan once again reported the lowest per-capita GDP ever , closely-followed by Burundi and Malawi . All three countries struggle economically , because of poorly developed infrastructure and a low standard of living . GDP per capita as an indicator A country 's gross domestic product , often referred to as GDP for short , is a means to measure the market value of goods and services a country has produced over a certain period of time . It is an important key indicator for a country 's economic status and development . GDP per capita is the breakdown of GDP to the country 's total population , showing how much each of the inhabitants have theoretically obtained . GDP per capita is a popular measure of the standard of living , prosperity , and overall well-being in a country . A high GDP per capita indicates a high standard of living , a low one indicates that a country is struggling to supply its inhabitants with everything they need . GDP per capita in South Sudan South Sudan 's 13 million inhabitants have been struggling with severe poverty , high death rates , civil wars , and violence for years now , and their standard of living is respectively low . Today , the country relies heavily on agriculture with the majority living in rural areas , but violence , the lack of food , and inefficient water supply often cause famine and illnesses . Since South Sudan thus can not produce and export goods efficiently and sufficiently , GDP per capita does not even reach four-figure levels , despite a quite low number of inhabitants . NGOs and government agencies are trying to improve their situation by offering funding and education , but significant improvement has yet to be seen .
