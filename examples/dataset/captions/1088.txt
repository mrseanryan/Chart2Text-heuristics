The Conservative party were the clear victors in the United Kingdom 's general election of 2019 , winning 365 seats out of 650 , meaning they now have a majority of 80 seats in the House of Commons . Boris Johnson will continue as Prime Minister , but in a far stronger position than before , while the leader of the Labour party , Jeremy Corbyn will resign before the next election . What does it mean for Brexit ? As a consequence of this result , the United Kingdom will almost certainly leave the European Union by the end of January 2020 . Prior to this election , both Johnson and his predecessor , Theresa May , had such a small majority in the UK parliament that they had to rely on Northern Ireland 's Democratic Unionist Party for support , as well as hardline factions within the Conservative party . This weak position cost both Johnson and May key votes on Brexit in the House of Commons , leading directly to this general election.Labour 's worst result since 1935 The Conservative party 's main rivals the Labour Party suffered their worst defeat since 1935 , after seeing their share of the vote decline by 7.8 percent . Due to the nature of the UK 's voting system , this translated into a loss of 59 seats across the whole country , with historic losses recorded in the party 's traditional heartlands of Northern England .
