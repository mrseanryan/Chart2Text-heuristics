Hewlett-Packard 's revenue from printers and copiers reached about 20 billion U.S. dollars in the fiscal year 2019 . The printing segment is one of two main business segments of HP Inc . Personal systems is HP Inc 's second business segment , which in 2019 generated around 38.7 billion U.S. dollars in revenue , bringing the company 's overall revenue to more than 58 billion U.S. dollars in that year . HP faces stagnant PC market HP Inc has so far been able to withstand the overall trend of a shrinking PC market , as the company has consistently shipped more than 50 million PCs annually over the past few years . Nevertheless , the company is adjusting to the changing market , for example by emphasizing the development of gaming computers , one segment that is bucking the overall PC market trend and growing . The company has also restructured its business model for selling devices . In 2017 , HP Inc debuted its `` device as a service '' program so businesses could pay for technology and associated services and support on a monthly basis . Split of Hewlett-Packard In 2015 Hewlett Packard split up into two separate entities , with HP Inc continuing to sell PCs and printers . The second new entity Hewlett Packard Enterprise ( HPE ) focuses on servers , storage , networking , and security services . Although Hewlett Packard 's leadership expected newly spun-off HP Enterprise to be the more promising half , HP Inc has gained strong momentum as an independent hardware company with its personal computer and printer divisions . As part of its push to remain a leader within the PC market , HP Inc acquired Samsung Electronics ' printer segment in 2017 for around one billion U.S. dollars , and in 2019 substantially expanded its business relationship with Xerox Corporation to meet a wider range of customer 's PC needs .
