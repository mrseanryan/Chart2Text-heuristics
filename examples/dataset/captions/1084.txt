According to the latest available data , New Mexico was the state with the highest teenage pregnancy rate in the U.S. , followed by Arkansas and Mississippi . Although New Mexico has the highest teen pregnancy rate , California is the state with the highest number of teenage pregnancies . In 2013 , there were almost 57,000 teenage pregnancies in California . Teenage pregnancy Teenage pregnancy rates in the United States have decreased in recent years . In 2013 , there were around 43 teenage pregnancies per 1,000 women aged 15 to 19 years . This number was almost 118 per 1,000 women in the year 1990 . It is believed that the causes of this decrease include more teens abstaining from sex and increased use of birth control among those teens who are sexually active . Contraception use The use of contraception among sexually active teens is vital in reducing the rates of teen pregnancy . However , in 2017 , only 54 percent of sexually active teens reported they used a condom during their last sexual intercourse . Furthermore , only 35 percent of sexually active female high school students used a prescription contraceptive method during their last sexual intercourse . Access to contraception and taboos surrounding teen sexual activity remain barriers to contraceptive use among teens in many areas of the United States .
