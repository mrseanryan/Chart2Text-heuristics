By 2019 it is expected that more than half of Canadians will be using over-the-top messaging apps on their phones , adding up to some 20.7 million users . A 2015 age group comparison shows that teenagers accounted for the majority of social and messaging app sessions as well as entertainment app sessions , while nearly half of app sessions for news and productivity categories belonged to users aged 35 to 54 . Gaming app sessions were dominated by seniors and followed by 35 to 54 year olds . All in all , Canadian smartphone users surveyed in 2015 downloaded a monthly average of 2.67 apps onto their device and uninstalled 5.27 apps . In fact , the average number of apps on Canadian smartphones fell from 26 to 19 between 2014 and 2015 . In terms of actual monthly use , younger generations were using more apps on their phones â€“ nearly 9 apps reported by respondents aged 18 to 24 , compared to 3 apps used monthly by senior Canadians .
