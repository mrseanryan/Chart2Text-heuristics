Gun laws in the United StatesGun ownership in the U.S. is protected by the 2nd Amendment of the Constitution , which allows citizens to own firearms and form a militia if necessary . Outside of the 2nd Amendment , gun laws in the U.S. vary from state to state , and gun owners are subject to the laws of the state they are currently in , not necessarily the state they live in . For example , if concealed carry is allowed in a gun owner 's state of residence , but not in the state they are travelling in , the owner is subject to the law of the state they are travelling in . Civilian-owned firearms The United States is estimated to have the highest rate of civilian-owned firearms in the world , and more than double that of Yemen , which has the second-highest gun ownership rate . Unfortunately , along with high gun ownership rates comes a higher number of homicides by firearm , which was about 11,000 homicides in 2017 .
