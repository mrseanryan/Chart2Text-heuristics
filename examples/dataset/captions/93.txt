The statistic shows global gross domestic product ( GDP ) from 2014 to 2018 , with projections up until 2024 . In 2018 , global GDP amounted to about 84.93 trillion U.S. dollars . Gross domestic product Gross domestic product , also known as GDP , is the accumulated value of all finished goods and services produced in a country , often measured annually . GDP is significant in determining the economic health , growth and productivity in the country , and is a stat often used when comparing several countries at a time , most likely in order to determine which country has seen the most progress . Global GDP has experienced a growth every year over the past decade with the exception of 2009 . However , a strong growth rate does not necessarily lead to all positive outcomes and often has a negative affect on inflation rates . A severe growth in GDP leads to less unemployment , however lower unemployment often leads to higher inflation rates due to demand increasing at a much higher rate than supply and as a result prices rise accordingly . Despite a relatively high global GDP growth , unemployment only marginally changed over the course of 5 years and is forecasted to remain stagnant going into 2017 . Unemployment , however , is often difficult to predict , primarily now since most economies are still recovering from the 2008 global financial crisis .
