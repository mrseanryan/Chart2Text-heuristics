In March 2018 , a patient in Accident and Emergency in the United Kingdom would spend an average of 64 minutes waiting before treatment would begin . Since the start of the provided time interval in 2011 this is the second longest average waiting time recorded . The only time it was higher was the average waiting time in March 2016 , which rose to 69 minutes . Since this point the average waiting time has gone above one hour on occasions whereas before this point it had never done so . Substantial waiting times experienced by patients Between January and March 2019 in England 85.1 percent of patients who attended A & E were admitted , transferred or discharged within four hours . This is well below the NHS 's target that 95 percent of attendees to A & E should be seen within four hours . Since 2011 , the share of patients seen within four hours has been declining . In addition , since 2016 there has been a marked increase in examples of patients waiting for more than twelve hours at A & E to be admitted . Increased number of attendances The reasons behind the increased waiting times and the missed treatment targets could be partially explained by the increased number of people attending A & E . There were over 6.2 million attendances to the A & E department in England in the fourth quarter 2018/19 . This figure has on the general increase since 2012 , which means there is a greater strain on emergency services across the country .
