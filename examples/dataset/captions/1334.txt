As recorded by the Spanish Statistics Institute ( INE ) , Moroccans ranked first as the foreign nationality with more residents in Spain in 2017 , closely followed by Colombians and Venezuelans . After years of losing its foreign population , Spain 's immigration figures started to pick up in 2015 , with the number of people that moved to the Mediterranean country surpassing the number of foreigners that decided to leave . The depopulation of a country Even though Spain is continually losing its nationals , the inflow migration figures of the European country saw an enormous increase over the last few years , ceasing the country 's ongoing downward trend in population in 2016 . The population of Spain has been in decline for many years and was projected to decrease by nearly one million by 2023 . This will not come as a surprise since Spain has the lowest fertility rate in the European Union , with barely 1.34 children per woman according to the latest reports . The European Union immigration context In 2015 , the European Union confronted a rising number of refugees arriving from the Middle East . Consequently , migration figures show that Germany accommodated approximately 14 million foreign-born citizens , ranking it as the country that most hosted immigrants in Europe in 2018 . By comparison , Spain 's foreign population stood merely over six million , positioning the Western Mediterranean country sixth on the European list of foreign-born population .
