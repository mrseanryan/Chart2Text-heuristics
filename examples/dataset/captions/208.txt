Arsenal FC currently leads the way with 13 FA Cup titles to the club 's name , the most recent win having come in 2017 . Hot on Arsenal 's heels is Manchester United , whose 2016 victory marked their 12th victory in the oldest club competition in the world . A cup for the underdogs ? There is often talk about the `` Magic of the FA Cup '' and how the competition brings up surprising results , with lower league teams beating higher placed ones . Indeed , the FA Cup has been won 10 times by teams outside the top division , most recently in 1980 with West Ham United 's victory over Arsenal . The rise of Chelsea FC The 2018 edition of the FA Cup was won by Chelsea , who beat Manchester City 1 - 0 in the final . This title marked Chelsea 's eighth success in the competition , drawing them level with Tottenham Hotspur on the overall number of titles . Six of Chelsea 's eight titles have come since the turn of the millennium , which can partly be attributed to the takeover of the club by Roman Abramovich in 2003 . The billionaire owner has injected significant amounts of cash into the club , meaning that the club 's brand value has increased from 314 million U.S. dollars in 2011 to almost 1.2 billion U.S. dollars in 2018 . This made Chelsea the third most valuable brand in the Premier League , just behind the two Manchester clubs . With this money comes the ability to attract superstars to the club and , in the 2018/19 season , the annual first-team player salary at Chelsea stood at over 5 million pounds .
