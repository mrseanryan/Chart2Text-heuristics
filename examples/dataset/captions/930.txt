Japan 's suicide numbers peaked in 2009 , when the country experienced its worst recession since World War II . That year , the suicide rate surged to 25.7 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants and almost 33 thousand victims in total . Despite noticeably decreasing suicide numbers in recent years , Japan still had one of the highest suicide rates among high-income OECD nations . In 2018 , the country reported 16.5 suicides per 100,000 inhabitants . What are the reasons behind Japan 's high suicide rates ? Historically , Japan 's high suicide rates were closely linked to the economic situation of individuals . While the majority of suicides in Japan stemmed from health reasons , existential worries and problems directly related to work accounted for over 5,000 self-inflicted deaths in 2018 . The most profound issue faced by employees in Japan leading to self-harm was exhaustion . An increasing pressure of retaining jobs by putting in more hours of overtime , while taking fewer holidays and sick days were seen as the main motivators behind the rising suicide numbers among office workers and employees . Occupational sudden mortality , known as karoshi ( `` death by overwork '' ) is a well-known phenomenon in Japanese society . Besides physical pressure , mental stress from the workplace can cause karoshi . Suicide due to occupational stress or overwork is called karojisatsu ( `` overwork suicide '' ) in Japan . Which demographic groups are affected ? While middle-aged men were frequently portrayed as the highest-risk group for suicide in Japan , suicides among elderly and school children were recurrently picked up by media . Financial anxiety , bullying , isolation and the lack of a proficient mental healthcare system were only some of the factors for contributing to the country 's high suicide rates amongst all age groups .
