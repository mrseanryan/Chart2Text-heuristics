There were 77,647 branches of FDIC-insured commercial banks in the United States in 2018 . After a period of growth from 2000 to 2008 , this number has been slowly diminishing in the past few years . In 2018 , Wells Fargo led the ranking of banks with the highest number of branches . What does the FDIC do ? The FDIC ( Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ) is an agency created by the United States Congress that guarantees the deposits in commercial banks up to 250,000 U.S. dollars . This protects depositors in the event that the bank becomes insolvent . It also enables banks to issue more loans , since depositors may prefer banks that are insured by the FDIC . Trends in the banking industry While the number of branches has stayed relatively stable , the number of FDIC-insured commercial banks has declined in recent years . As younger generations become more accustomed to online and digital banking , the need for bank branches may also wane .
