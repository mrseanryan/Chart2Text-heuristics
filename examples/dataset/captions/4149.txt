The statistic shows fossil fuel energy consumption in the United States between 1985 and 2018 . Here , the consumption of energy derived from fossil fuels came to approximately 81.2 quadrillion British thermal units in 2018 . Fossil fuel energies â€“ additional informationFossil fuels are hydrocarbon-containing natural resources formed from the remains of dead plants or animals that have been subject to immense pressure from a buildup of layers over millions of years . There are three major forms of fossil fuels : coal , oil , and natural gas which were considered the world 's primary energy source since the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century . The energy demand in the United States is largely covered by fossil fuels . In 2017 , the U.S. generated approximately 4.02 trillion kilowatt hours of electricity . About 82 % of the electricity generated was from fossil fuels and nuclear resources . Petroleum is one of the county 's main energy sources with more than 36 quadrillion British thermal units consumed in 2017 . The liquid is predominantly used in the transportation sector . Despite its prominent use over the last few centuries , fossil fuels are finite resources and burning these fuels can harm the environment . Under the threat of climate change , the pollution caused by fossil fuels has put the industry under scrutiny . Burning any fossil fuels produces carbon dioxide , a greenhouse gas which contributes to global warming . The volume of global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions has steadily risen over the last few decades , from 15.54 gigatons in 1975 to 33.14 gigatons in 2018 . There are several alternative resources that can supply clean energy , including water , biomass , wind , geothermal and solar energy . These renewable energy sources are slowly becoming more efficient and are argued to be competitive with fossil fuels as a means to cover global energy needs .
