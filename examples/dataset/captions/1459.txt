One could be forgiven for expecting the world 's busiest domestic air route to link two major megalopolises , each with populations in the tens of millions . However , it is not until the third busiest – Mumbai to Delhi –that this is the case . Instead , the busiest air route was Seoul to the tourist island of Jeju , which recorded almost 65,000 flights , followed by Sydney to Melbourne with just under 55,000 flights . Domestic versus international routes Domestic air routes , defined as commercial flights between two airports that are in the same country , tend to be busier than international air routes . Even the busiest international air route – Hong Kong to Taipei – recorded less than half the number of flights in 2017 than the busiest domestic route . Causes of air traffic Population is clearly a factor for high levels of air traffic , with just over half of the busiest domestic air routes involving the most populous global megacities . However , a lack of alternative travel infrastructure can also play a major role . For example , Brisbane , Melbourne and Sydney – which together account for two of the busiest air routes , despite their relatively small populations – are yet to be linked by high-speed intercity rail .
