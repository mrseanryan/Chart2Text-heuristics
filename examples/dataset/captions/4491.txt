Many of the largest solar power facilities in the world are located in India and China . For example , the Tengger solar park in China is located in Zhongwei , Ningxia , covering 1,200 kilometers of the Tengger desert and has an output of 1,547 megawatts of power . In India , Bhadla solar farm , located in the Rajasthan Jodhpur district is set to be in operation in December 2019 . It is expected to be able to produce 2,255 megawatts of electricity and is spread across 45 square kilometers . In this case , the term solar plant refers to individual projects developed by a single developer or consortium , whether or not it is spread over different sites or is under various phases of development . Solar parks are multiple plants in one area under one entity . Nowadays , the largest solar parks have more than 50 individual solar power plants . This concept was first developed in India and China when suitable locations were found that could host several plants . Solar market in AsiaChina and India are both among the top five countries in the world in terms of cumulative solar photovoltaic ( PV ) capacity . In general , Asia dominated the global solar market with 70 gigawatts of solar PV capacity added in 2018 â€“ more than the rest of the world combined . Most notably , the potential for solar energy is very high in many Southeast Asian countries , but the market remains largely untapped . This is mostly due to a lack of energy policy encouraging solar and no optimal financing models or infrastructure .
