This growth is expected to continue , as people from rural areas migrate to urban areas due to the economy and employment continuing to shift from agriculture to industry and services . At present , the largest city in terms of population is Kuala Lumpur , which is home to around 1.31 million inhabitants - which is still relatively small , considering that the entire population of Malaysia amounts to around 31 million .

Urban areas in Malaysia , notably Kuala Lumpur , are less dense than is common for urban areas in East Asia . This means that dealing with and limiting sprawl will be a challenge . As the urban transformation continues , there is still a chance to find a balance between urban and rural settlements in an equitable , compact and sustainable manner .
