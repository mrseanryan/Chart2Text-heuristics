Founded in Sweden in 2003 , King is a video game developer that is most famous for its blockbuster gaming hit , Candy Crush Saga . The developer 's revenue reached two billion U.S. dollars in 2018 , a marked increase from revenue of less than 60 million U.S. dollars in 2010 . King of the developers In its early years in the social gaming world , King relied on in-game advertising and micro-transactions to generate revenue . The latter enabled players to make in-game purchases to improve their virtual world or help them past a particularly tricky level . However , in a move to win over its legion of fans , the company decided to remove all in-game advertising in June 2013 and focused on micro-transactions to bring in the money . This strategy seemed to pay off as the monthly active users of King continued to increase and peaked at 550 million users at the beginning of 2015 . However , the MAU figure has been steadily falling in the ensuing years and the company was acquired in February 2016 by Activision Blizzard , famed for games such as World of Warcraft and Overwatch , in a deal worth almost six billion U.S. dollars . The publisher has since seen an upturn in its fortunes and registered record operating income of 750 million U.S. dollars in 2018 . Candy Crush Saga – King 's jewel in the crown The more than tenfold increase of King 's revenue between 2012 and 2013 is down to just one game – Candy Crush Saga . The colorful puzzle game became an overnight sensation and could be seen on smartphones across the world . While the game itself is free-to-play , users have the option of making in-game purchases to help them get past certain levels . This is where King 's micro-transaction revenue model truly paid off as player spending in Candy Crush mobile games worldwide reached over 1.4 billion U.S. dollars in 2018 . Despite the fast-paced nature of mobile gaming and the new releases that hit our screens every day , Candy Crush Saga still remains one of the most popular free-to-play games on the market .
