Dutch households had nearly 715 billion euros of outstanding mortgage loans at the end of 2018 , a significant value when compared to earlier years . Despite its relatively small population size , the Netherlands had a much higher mortgage debt than most other European countries and was not far from those found in the United Kingdom , France or Germany . This has a political background as the Dutch government for many years wanted to help people to buy a house . The tax system allowed homeowners to deduct interests paid on mortgage from pre-tax income for a maximum period of thirty years . This was known as hypotheekrenteaftrek , and consequently lead to the Netherlands becoming the European country with the highest share of the population who is an owner-occupier with a mortgage . Since 2014 , the Dutch government is slowly scaling this tax facility down , with an acceleration planned from 2020 onwards . What are the biggest companies in the Dutch mortgage market ? Banks ABN AMRO , Rabobank and ING provided more than half of mortgages in the Netherlands in 2019 . Another 11 percent of the market was provided by banks outside the traditional top three . Note that these are combined numbers , as there are no market shares that look at mortgage providers individually . Banks , insurance companies , regiepartijen ( funds that originate mortgage loans on behalf of institutional investors , no English word exists for this term ) and other providers do not have to share this information openly . Housing in the Netherlands and the risk of water As many people in the Netherlands both own a house and have a mortgage as well , a big theme is the risk of a house going underwater or negative home equity . This occurs when people effectively pay more for their mortgage than their house is worth and happened , for example , between 2009 and 2013 , when the average valuation of a house outweighed the average selling price . For this risk alone , one can find much data on residential property in the Netherlands . For example , quarterly pulse monitors state that housing prices in the Netherlands are set to increase but decelerate in 2020 .
