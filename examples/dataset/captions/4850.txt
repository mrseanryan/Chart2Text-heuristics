Almost every Automated teller Machine ( ATM ) in the United Kingdom ( UK ) is a part of the Link network . During the previous 12-month period , an average of almost 230 million transactions using Link cash machines take place every month , accounting for an average of 10 billion British pounds in withdrawals . Free to use cash machines In 2018 , over 80 percent of cash machines in the United Kingdom were free to use . Whether an ATM is free to use appears to be a very important factor as to if the machine is used to withdraw money . During 2018 , free to use ATM 's accounted for 98 percent of withdrawals . The other two percent of withdrawals were made using the 14.6 thousand fee-based machines situated in the UK . ATM 's fall across Europe Between 2016 and 2018 , the number of ATM 's in Europe has fallen by almost 14 thousand . Each ATM in Europe services an average of over 64 thousand individuals . The decrease in Automated Teller Machines in Europe has been a direct cause of the rise in cashless payments . Across the continent , people are choosing to use cards and mobile payments as their preferred process instead of the incumbency of using physical cash .
