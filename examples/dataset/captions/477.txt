This statistic shows the world 's leading fishing nations in 2017 , based on capture production . China caught about 15.37 million metric tons of fish in that year . Worldwide fishing The act of fishing dates back to thousands of years before the Common Era . Fishing was well-suited to the lifestyle of the hunter-gatherer , who would engage himself in the act when presented with a body of water . Ancient fishing tools could consist of a spear , a rod , a net , or merely a pair of human hands . Since then , fishing techniques have developed extensively and one can see many different techniques both traditional and modern at work around the globe today . Worldwide fish production is increasing yearly , presumably meeting the demands of a growing world population . Fresh fish is in highest demand , but there are a myriad of routes to consumption , including frozen , canned , and smoked , as well as certain non-food purposes , such as for fish meal , fish oil , or fertilizer . With such a high demand , overfishing is fast becoming a problem . Overfishing occurs when fish populations are unacceptably reduced due to human fishing activities . This can prove disastrous for fish species as well as fishing-dependent coastal communities , not to mention the effect on the marine ecosystem . While some criticize the taste and life quality of farm-raised fish , this may be a better option for fish-eating consumers concerned about the environment .
