The United States was the leading country for exports from the United Kingdom , with 15.8 percent of all UK exports going to this market . Germany was the second largest export market for the UK in this year , followed by the Netherlands , with these countries accounting for 10.4 percent and 7.6 percent of UK exports respectively . UK imports most from Germany Although the United States was the largest export market , Germany was the country from which the UK imported the highest share of goods , with 13.9 percent of the UK 's imports coming from its European neighbor . China was the second most important source of imports for the UK , with nine percent coming from there in 2018 . European Single Market still the UK 's biggest market As of 2018 , the European Single Market remains the largest trade partner for the United Kingdom , with around half of UK exports going there , and almost 60 percent of UK imports originating there . This may of course change in the future after the UK leaves the single market following the Brexit referendum of 2016 .
