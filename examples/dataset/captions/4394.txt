Most U.S. solar installations require the use of imported panels , largely coming from Asia . About 45 percent of solar photovoltaic imports into the United States came from Malaysia between January and August 2019 . About 58 percent of voters in the United States stated that they opposed imposing tariffs on these imported energy panels . Solar import tariffs In 2018 , President Donald Trump tacked on duties of as much as 30 percent onto solar power products from outside of the domestic market . These safeguard tariffs were placed onto imported silicon solar cells and modules and will apply for four years . Previously in 2014 , the International Trade Commission ( ITC ) had implemented restrictions on solar products manufactured in China and Taiwan to prevent dumping , and thus , the United States began to receive imports largely from Malaysia , South Korea , and Singapore . How is the solar market now ? The solar tariffs have had an impact on the overall price of solar in the United States and the number of solar energy-related jobs after the initial trade complaint was filed in 2017 . However , the solar energy industry in the United States continues to prosper in spite of the import tariffs placed on this renewable energy source .
