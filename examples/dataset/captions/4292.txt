This statistic displays the average tenancy void periods for rental properties in the private rented sector in the United Kingdom ( UK ) from the fourth quarter of 2013 to the third quarter of 2019 . Void periods constitute an important measure for the private rental markets , as they are one of the major reasons for the loss of expected rental income . They require careful planning and budgeting , to keep the time when the property is not bringing the profit to the minimum and to make sure that all necessary expenses are still covered during the void period . As these differ across the cities , towns and regions , researching of the historical data , reflecting the trends of void periods for the local area , is seen as a good way to get an understanding of long-term trends.For all of the United Kingdom , data from end of 2013 till quarter three of 2018 showed that the void periods were shortest as of the first quarter of 2015 , counting on average 2.4 weeks . They grew in length to 2.7 weeks in the the last two quarters of 2016 and have stayed at that time length up until the fourth quarter of 2017 .
