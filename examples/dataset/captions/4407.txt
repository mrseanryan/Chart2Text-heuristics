Foundered ships accounted for 30 of the 46 ship losses in 2018 . Cargo ships are the most lost vessel type . What causes ship losses ? December and January see more losses than other months because unpredictable or poor weather conditions cause many vessels to capsize . Other reasons for ship losses include faulty equipment or human error , which can be a key factor in vessel collisions . There was only one ship that was lost due to collision in 2018 : crude oil tanker Sanchi . Not only did this collision lead to 113,000 metric tons of oil being leaked , but it resulted in the deaths of Sanchi 's 32 crew members , while the crew of the other ship involved was rescued . Malpractice from both crews is said to have led to the disaster . Shipping is the origin of insurance Modern insurance schemes began in the late 17th century in order to spread out the risk of losing merchant vessels at sea . Lloyd 's coffee house in London was a meeting place for mariners to obtain insurance and receive maritime news . This coffee house would eventually become Lloyd 's of London , one of the world 's largest insurance markets . Lloyd 's is still heavily involved in the shipping industry .
