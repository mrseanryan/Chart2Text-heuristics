One of the first mass recycling programs in the United States was implemented in 1970 in Hawaii . Since then , the recovery of municipal solid waste ( MSW ) for recycling has increased , reaching 67.2 million tons in 2017 . U.S. recycling since China 's plastic import ban China was once the largest purchaser of plastic imports from the United States , but in 2017 , China implemented a ban on the import of most plastic waste , with the exception of only the highest quality plastics . Instead , countries like Vietnam , Turkey , and Malaysia have taken on the burden of plastic waste . Much of the previously exported plastic waste must now be dealt with domestically , and many municipalities are struggling , finding that many plastic products can not be recycled . Since the ban , many cities have been unable to keep up with the volume of recycled goods , and hundreds of local recycling programs have collapsed . Single stream recycling In the United States , single stream recycling is commonly used by material recovery facilities ( MRFs ) . This system allows many different types of recyclables , including paper , plastic , metal , and glass to be placed into one container and is then collected and sorted within the MRF . Single stream recycling tends to increase recycling rates due to its ease , encouraging consumers to recycle . However , allowing consumers to put all materials into one waste bin increases contamination such as broken glass or presence of non-recyclable items . Single stream recycling tends to decrease the quality of materials recovered .
