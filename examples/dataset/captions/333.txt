This statistic depicts the number of pirate attacks against ships worldwide from 2010 through 2019 . There were 162 such incidents in 2019 . Pirate attacks Although the term `` pirate '' may conjure up images of bearded men with eye patches , wooden legs and parrots who were convicted and buried centuries ago , pirate attacks are indeed posing a threat to today 's shipping lines all over the world . Contemporary maritime piracy reached its peak level in 2010 , with around 445 reported incidents . The regions most likely to come under threat from pirate attacks include Indonesia , the Malaysia , and Nigeria . Here , pirates are attracted by the abundance of natural resources in the countries themselves or in adjacent areas . Strategic passages for oil transport such as Bab-el-Mandeb , near Somalia , or the Strait of Malacca off the Indonesian coast have become notorious targets for maritime crime . In 2013 , oil tankers shipped 15.2 million barrels of oil per day through the Strait of Malacca ; this exceeds the daily volume of oil imported into the whole of the European Union . With oil prices hovering around 70 U.S. dollars per barrel in 2018 , the hijacking of a crude oil tanker sounds like a promising deal for pirates . In 2017 , Venezuela was thrust into the limelight : Here , the number of incidents rose from five to 12 between 2016 and 2017 . It is often the crew and the pirates themselves who pay most dearly for maritime crime . In Somali waters , at least 149 crew members were held hostage in 2011 , and over 100 pirates were killed - mostly by naval forces such as armed guards , who are increasingly seen to be of central importance to the protection of merchant ships .
