The Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair saw an astonishing growth in the amount of net profits generated , before suffering a roughly 39 percent decline in its latest financial year . Between 2012/13 and 2017/18 , the Dublin based company was able to nearly triple their net profits . In 2017/18 , this figure reached 1.45 billion euros , roughly 10 million euros lower than its peak in 2015/16 , before dropping to 885 million euros in 2018/19.Ryanair was established in 1984 and heavily profited from the European Union 's deregulation of the air industry in 1998 , allowing it to operate air travel between other EU member states . Why the fall in profits ? With its generally affordable ticket prices , Ryanair 's increase in profitability observed until 2017/18 , was mainly due to a growing number of passengers choosing to travel with the airline . However , the company states that higher oil prices as well as greater payroll costs , extended strikes by air traffic control and staff shortage resulted in the prominent decline of net profits seen in 2018/19 . Commercial airline profits Net profits of worldwide commercial airlines were at an all time high in 2017 . Despite a decline for 2019 , figures were still significantly greater than those reported at the beginning of the decade . However , airlines operating in Europe were set to see a more pronounced decline in profits compared to those from other regions .
