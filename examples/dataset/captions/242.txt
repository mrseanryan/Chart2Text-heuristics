In 2019 , the Chinese population amounted to around 1.40 billion people . Forecasts as calculated by the IMF see the Chinese population growing to 1.41 billion until 2022 and then beginning to decline for the first time in decades . Forecasts by the Chinese administration expect this turning point coming several years later in the early 2030s . Population development in China As of mid 2018 , China was the country with the largest population worldwide , closely followed by India , which ranked second with a population of about 1.37 billion people . As population growth in India is higher than in China , India will soon become the most populous country in the world . Due to several mechanisms put into place by the Chinese government as well as changing circumstances in the working and social environment of the Chinese people , population growth has subsided over the past decades , displaying an annual population growth rate of merely around 0.5 percent in recent years . Nevertheless , compared to the world population in total , China held a share of about 19 percent of the overall global population in 2010 . China 's aging population In terms of demographic developments , the birth control efforts of the Chinese government had considerable effects on the demographic pyramid in China . Upon closer examination of the age distribution , a clear trend of an aging population becomes visible . In order to curb the negative effects of an aging population , the Chinese government abolished the one-child policy in 2015 , which had been in effect since 1979 . However , many Chinese parents nowadays are reluctant to have a second or third child , as it is the case in most of the developed countries in the world . The number of births in China varied in the years following the abolishment of the one-child policy , but did not increase considerably . Among the reasons most prominent for parents not having more children are the rising living costs and costs for child care , growing work pressure , a growing trend towards self-realization and individualism , and changing social behaviors .
