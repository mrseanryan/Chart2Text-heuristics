The statistic shows the development of the world population from 1950 to 2050 . The world population was around 7.38 billion people in 2015 . The global population As shown above , the total number of people living on Earth has more than doubled since the 1950s , and continues to increase . A look at the development of the world population since the beginning of the Common Era shows that such a surge in numbers is unprecedented . The first significant rise in population occurred during the 14th century , after the Black Death had killed approximately 25 million people worldwide . Subsequently , the global population increased slowly but steadily until it reached record numbers between 1950 and 2000 . The majority of the global population lives on the Asian continent , as a statistic of the world population by continent shows . In around 100 years , it is estimated that population levels on the African continent will have reached similar levels to those we see in Asia today . As for a forecast of the development of the world population , the figures are estimated to have reached more than 10 billion by the 22nd century . Growing population numbers pose an increasing risk to the planet , since rocketing numbers equal increased consumption of food and resources . Scientists worry that natural resources , such as oil , and food resources will become scarce , endangering the human race and , even more so , the world 's ecosystem . Nowadays , the number of undernourished / starving people worldwide has decreased slightly , but forecasts paint a darker picture .
