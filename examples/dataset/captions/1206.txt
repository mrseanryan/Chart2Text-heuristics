How many games in the World Cup ? The 1998 World Cup Finals in France saw a change to the format that had been used for the previous four tournaments . The format for the finals was initially changed for the 1982 World Cup in Spain in which 24 teams participated . The current format , first implemented in France 1998 , sees 32 teams split into eight groups of four . As a result , the last six editions of the World Cup , including the latest World Cup in Russia in 2018 , featured 64 games . World Cup goal fests A total of 171 goals were scored across the 2014 FIFA World Cup held in Brazil , marking a joint record for the tournament along with France 1998 . The goal-fest in 2014 was thanks to some unusually high-scoring games , including Netherlands beating Spain 5 - 1 in the group stages and , most famously , Germany embarrassing Brazil 7 - 1 at the semi-final stage . The 2014 World Cup in Brazil also holds the record for the most amount of different scorers in a single tournament with 121 players . World Cup goal-scorers One of the most notable scorers at the 2014 World Cup was Germany 's Miroslav Klose , who became the leading goal-scorer of all time in World Cups , with his record-breaking 16th goal coming in that infamous semi final against Brazil . The top goal-scorer at the last World Cup in 2018 was England captain , Harry Kane . The forward scored six goals across the tournament , including a hattrick in England 's 6 - 1 drubbing of Panama . However , his goal-scoring exploits did not stop England from falling short of glory as they were knocked out by Croatia in the semi-finals .
