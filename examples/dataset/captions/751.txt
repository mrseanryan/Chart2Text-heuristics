This statistic shows the Ukrainian gross domestic product ( GDP ) from 1994 to 2018 in billion U.S. dollars , with projections up until 2024 . In 2018 , Ukraine 's GDP amounted to approximately 130.86 billion U.S. dollars . See the Russian GDP for comparison . Ukraine 's rocky economy In just two years , between 2013 and 2015 , GDP in Ukraine has been dramatically reduced to half its amount . This very severe decrease is mainly due to the armed conflict in the eastern part of the country , which is causing many of its inhabitants to be internally displaced , and life in general to become increasingly difficult for Ukrainians - not just because of the war , but because the country 's economy is in desperate trouble : The inflation rate has risen to almost 50 percent , the second highest rate around the world behind Venezuela , and unemployment is now at over 11 percent . The industrial Donbass region located to the east of the country has also been devastated . Russia , Ukraine 's most important import and export partner until recently , most likely no longer plays this role , having caused a great shift in the country 's base economy . Ukraine 's national debt in relation to GDP is also unsustainable , having increased by over 50 percent in the last two years . Default or restructuring of its debt was inevitable , and eventually restructuring took place in August 2015 . While the economy is expected to recover somewhat in 2016 , its stability will depend on improving the stability of the country in order to create an environment in which the economy can operate and recover .
