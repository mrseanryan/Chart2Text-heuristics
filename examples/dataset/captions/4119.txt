The science fiction movie 2.0 was ranked as the all-time highest budget movie in India with a production value of almost six billion Indian rupees . Saaho , another action thriller produced in 2019 became the second highest big-budget film costing over 3.2 billion rupees . The business of Bollywood The Indian film industry was valued at over 180 billion rupees in fiscal year 2019 , and it was estimated to reach up to 260 billion rupees by the end of fiscal year 2024 . Out of this , the highest earnings came from domestic theatrical revenues , worth almost 125 billion rupees . In fact , the country 's film industry recorded a 15.3 percent growth in revenue that year compared to fiscal year 2018 . One of the main reasons for this growth was the revived focus on regional cinema , along with revenue from other sources like in-cinema advertising , digital rights distribution and music use and distribution rights . Quality over quantity However , higher budgets do not necessarily mean profitable movies . Case in point - 2019 film Uri-The Surgical Strike . This was produced at a budget of around 420 million rupees- far lower than 2.0 or Saaho . And yet , the film managed to get a whopping 876 percent return on investments , surpassing the combined costs of its advertisements as well as production expenses within just ten days of its release . Perhaps Bollywood producers can learn a lesson or two from this about the triumph of quality over quantity .
