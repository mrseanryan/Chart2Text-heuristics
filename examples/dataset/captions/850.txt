Heart disease is currently the leading cause of death in the United States , accounting for 23 percent of all deaths . Other leading causes of death include cancer , accidents , chronic lower respiratory diseases and cerebrovascular diseases . The leading causes of death worldwide are like those in the U.S . However , lung cancer , road injury , diarrheal diseases and tuberculosis are all major causes of death worldwide , but are not among the leading causes in the U.S . Instead , accidents , influenza and pneumonia , intentional self-harm and kidney diseases have a larger impact in the U.S . Racial differences In the United States , there exist slight differences in leading causes of death depending on race and ethnicity . For example , assault , or homicide , accounts for around 3 percent of all deaths among the black population but is not even among the leading causes of death for other races and ethnicities . However , heart disease and cancer are still the leading causes of death for all races and ethnicities . Gender differences Similarly , there are also differences in the leading causes of death in the U.S. depending on gender . For example , among males , intentional self-harm accounts for around 2.5 percent of all deaths but is not among the leading causes of death among females . On the other hand , septicemia and influenza and pneumonia account for more deaths among women than men .
