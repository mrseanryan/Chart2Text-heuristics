Over the past decade the turnover from off-course horse race betting in the United Kingdom ( UK ) has significantly decreased from 5.74 billion British pounds in 2009 to 4.22 billion in 2019 . A similar trend can be seen with off course dog race betting . Despite a slight decrease , the number of betting shops still held steady though , with William Hill and Ladbrokes making up roughly half of the shops . On-course betting also on the decline As the gambling trends in the UK shift more and more towards online gambling , also the turnover of on-course betting decreases . However the overall gross gambling yield ( GGY ) of the betting sector remains stable at roughly 3.25 billion British pounds in 2019 . Remote gambling on the rise When looking at the entire GGY over time , the remote betting , bingo and casino sector quickly exploded onto the market and now accounts for the largest market share , reaching approximately 5.32 billion British pounds in 2019 . In addition , the number of employees in the remote gambling sector rapidly increased as well .
