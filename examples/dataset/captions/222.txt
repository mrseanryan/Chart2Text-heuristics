The United States is the most successful nation of all time at the Summer Olympic Games , having amassed a total of 2,520 medals since the first Olympics in 1896 . Team USA gets the gold medalOf the 2,520 medals won by Team USA over the years , over one thousand have been gold . The dominance of the United States can be shown in the fact that only two other nations , Russia and Germany , have reached a combined medal tally of 1,000 . The United States team has been present at every edition of the Olympics except for the 1980 Summer Olympics held in Moscow , which they boycotted in protest against the Soviet Union 's invasion of Afghanistan during the height of the Cold War . In the most recent Summer Olympics , held in Rio de Janiero in 2016 , Team USA emerged with 121 medals , making it their third most successful Olympics in history . The team were able to claim 46 gold medals across a record 35 sports , including men 's basketball , women 's water polo , and tennis mixed doubles . Team USA only second best in the Winter Olympics The United States ' unrivalled success in the Summer Olympics is not quite matched in the Winter Olympics . Whilst Team USA claims second spot in the all-time medal tally with an impressive 305 medals , they are just beaten by Norway , who have claimed 368 medals since 1924 . This tally is very impressive considering Norway 's population stands at just over five million inhabitants , a fraction of the size of the United States . Indeed , the most successful Winter Olympian of all time , Marit Bj√∏rgen , hails from the Scandinavian country . The cross-country skiier collected eight gold medals , four silver , and three bronze in a dazzling career that spanned five Winter Olympics between 2002 and 2018 .
