This statistic shows the ten largest cities in Ukraine in 2016 . Around 2.91 million people lived in Kiev in 2016 , making it the largest city in Ukraine . Economic situation in the Ukraine Ukraine has a population of around 42 million inhabitants - close to 70 percent of which live in urban areas , with almost 3 million living in Ukraine 's largest city and capital , Kiev . The city is located in the north central part of the country on the Dnieper River and is one of the largest in Europe . The country 's second largest city , Charkiv , is about half of Kiev 's size and located in the northeast . Charkiv was the first city to be occupied by the Soviet Union in 1917 until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 . Since the collapse , Ukraine has been largely divided between east and west . Many inhabitants speak Ukrainian to the west , whereas Russian is dominant in parts of the east and south . Like Charkiv , many of Ukraine 's other biggest cities which have less than 1 million inhabitants are located to the east of the country â€“ a region which has uprooted and displaced many its inhabitants because of the war . Not only are rising numbers of Ukrainians still being internally displaced , but Ukrainians across the country are directly affected by a huge spike in inflation which reached near 50 percent in 2015 . Unemployment has also risen to more than 11 percent , and the country 's GDP has also been significantly impacted by the chaos . This situation has left many Ukrainians in need of aid , and internal displacement is still rising .
