While Hollywood may be the best-known film industry , the Indian film industry , also known as Bollywood , is the largest in the world in terms of the number of films produced . Around 1,500 to 2,000 films are produced every year in more than 20 languages . However , in terms of revenue generated , Bollywood remains nascent compared to other global industries . In 2018 , the highest grossing film at the box office in India was Dangal , earning over 387 million Indian rupees and over 340 million U.S. dollars in the global box office . Money matters Although Bollywood enjoys popularity in many parts of the world , the main revenue for this industry comes from the domestic box office , representing 74 percent of the total industry . In 2018 , the value of the Indian film industry was around 159 billion Indian rupees and it was forecasted to reach up to 229 billion rupees by 2023 . Rise of regional cinema In a country as diverse as India , the power and reach of regional cinema is often overlooked . Yet , regional cinema with their local flavours enjoy tremendous popularity in the country . The South Indian film industry is vibrant with several big budget films released each year . The share of regional box office contribution across India was over 48 percent in 2018 , with Tamil language films leading the race ( 948615 ) . In fact , the Tamil language film 2.0 which was released in 2018 had a production budget of over 5.8 billion Indian rupees , making it the biggest Bollywood movie production of all time .
