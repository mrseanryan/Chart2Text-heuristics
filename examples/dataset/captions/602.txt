The statistic shows the total population of South Korea from 2014 to 2018 , with projections up until 2024 . In 2018 , the total population of South Korea was about 51.64 million people . Population of South Korea South Korea , also called Republic of Korea , has one of the highest population densities worldwide , i.e . a very high number of inhabitants per square kilometer . However , this does not equal bad standard of living ; on the Human Development Index , which ranks countries by their level of living standards using key factors , such as unemployment rate , literacy rate , fertility and mortality rates , etc. , South Korea is among the highest-ranked countries . When looking at the aforementioned key factors , South Korea indeed seems to offer a fairly stable environment for its inhabitants , economically and demographically : The country 's unemployment rate has been relatively steady for the past decade , its gross domestic product ( GDP ) is constantly increasing , and it is among the countries with the highest trade surplus worldwide . As for standard of living , life expectancy at birth in South Korea is among the highest worldwide â€“ South Korea is even mentioned in a recent ranking of the best birthplaces for children . Despite the high population density , South Korea is now one of the countries with the lowest fertility rates , i.e . the number of babies born by women of childbearing age . This apparent discrepancy could be explained by a high number of immigrants coupled with the aforementioned high life expectancy .
