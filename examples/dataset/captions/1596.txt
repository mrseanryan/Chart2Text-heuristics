In 2018 , the mortality rate in China increased to 7.13 deaths per 1,000 inhabitants . The mortality rate presented a slowly growing trend over the past twenty years . The growing mortality rate can be attributed to the slower growth of the whole population . Population in China China is the most populous country in the world . Due to several mechanisms put into place by the Chinese government as well as changing circumstances in the working and social environment of the Chinese people , population growth has subsided over the past decades . The major factor for a slower population growth was a set of policies introduced by the Chinese government in 1979 , including the so-called one-child policy , which was intended to improve people 's living standards by limiting the population growth . However , with the decreasing birth rate and slower population growth , China nowadays is facing the problems of a rapidly aging population . Birth control in China According to the one-child policy , a married couple was only allowed to have one child . Only under certain circumstances were parents allowed to have a second child . As the performance of family control had long been related to the assessment of local government 's achievements , violations of the rule were severely punished . The birth control in China led to a decreasing birth rate and a more skewed gender ratio of new births due to a widely preference for male children in the Chinese society . Nowadays , since China 's population is aging rapidly , the one-child policy has been re-considered as an obstacle for the country 's further economic development . Since 2014 , the one-child policy has been gradually relaxed and fully eliminated at the end of 2015 . However , many young Chinese people today are not willing to have more children due to high costs of raising a child , especially in urban areas .
