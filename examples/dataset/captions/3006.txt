In 2018 , the population density in Indonesia was at about 147.75 people per square kilometer . Despite being the fourth largest country in the world in terms of population , Indonesia 's population density is mitigated by its abundance of land â€“ Indonesia is an archipelago of more than 17 thousand islands sprawled across more than five thousand kilometers from east to west . Java as the heart of Indonesia Despite the many thousands of islands , Indonesia 's population , politics , and economy are mostly centered on the island of Java . This is where its capital , Jakarta , is located . With a population of around 36.3 million in 2015 , Jakarta is not only Indonesia 's biggest city , it is also one of the world 's most-populated urban areas . The number of inhabitants in Jakarta increased three-fold since 1975 , reflecting a trend of rural-urban migration in Indonesia . Urban-rural dichotomy Indonesia 's rural population had been steadily decreasing in the last ten years ; inversely , its urban population saw a steady increase . As of 2018 , more than 55 percent of the Indonesian population were living in urban areas . In Indonesia , the economic opportunities are mostly concentrated in the larger and more densely populated islands such as Java and Bali , and smaller , rural , and more far-flung islands such as the Malukkus tend to suffer from a lack of easy connectivity to these economic centers . It comes as no surprise that these rural areas had the highest share of the rural population living below the poverty line . With their lack of economic prospects , rural populations in Indonesia also had a significantly higher share of those living below the poverty line than urban populations .
