' In a report on the number of new books and editions published in the United States in the ‘ literature ' category from 2002 to 2013 , the figures seemed to peak in 2009 whereby 11,456 new books were published . In 2012 , the figure for new literature had dropped to 7,004 for the whole of the United States . The time necessary to read selected bestsellers was determined through a survey in 2014 . In order to read the series `` A Song of Ice and Fire '' by George R.R . Martin , from cover to cover , it was estimated that a reader would need 98.33 hours . For readers with less time on their hands however , `` The Alchemist '' by Paulo Coelho would only take up 2.18 hours . But , as the American philosopher Mortimer J. Adler once said , `` In the case of good books , the point is not to see how many of them you can get through , but rather how many can get through to you . ''
