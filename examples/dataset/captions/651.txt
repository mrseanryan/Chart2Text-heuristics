In 2018 , the national debt of India amounted to around 1.8 trillion U.S. dollars . Projections show an upward trend , with a significant increase each year . Honor thy national debt National debt , also called government debt or public debt , is money owed by the federal government . It can be divided into internal debt , ( which is owed to lenders in the country ) and external debt ( which is owed to foreign lenders ) . National debt is created and increased by using government bonds , for example , or by borrowing money from other nations due to financial struggles ( well-known case in point : Greece ) . A quite complex issue , national debt is expected to be paid back in accordance with certain regulations overseen by the Bank for International Settlements ( BIS ) , a financial organization owned by central banks . India 's debt is rising , but so is its economic growth India 's liabilities have increased significantly , and forecasts show no end in sight . While India is a fast-growing economy and considered one of the main emerging economies , the so-called BRIC countries , India has been investing and borrowing money from commercial banks as well as several non-banking finance companies , and its national debt today makes up almost 70 percent of its GDP . Luckily , even though the national debt is forecast to increase , this share of GDP is predicted to decrease , as is the trade deficit in the long run , despite a significant jump back into the red in 2017 .
