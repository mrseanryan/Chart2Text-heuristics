Deliveries of BMW MINI-badged cars stood at about 361,500 units in 2018 . BMW has operated the MINI brand since 2000 and adapted the trademark compact style originally designed by Birmingham-based British Motor Corporation ( BMC ) to meet modern preferences . In the UK , the MINI brand was launched with great success . MINI has a UK car registration share of about three percent and accounts for almost 30 percent of BMW Group 's vehicle sales in the United Kingdom . Origin of MINI The MINI brand was originally a small two-door hatchback that became synonymous with 1960s British style and motoring . The MINI was even developed as a successful rally car , with its compact and low center of gravity design able to accelerate around tight corners . MINI 's place as a cultural icon was set in stone as it featured in a 1969 caper film , The Italian Job . Design changes The United States has become one of MIN 's largest markets . In light of MINI 's dwindling U.S. market share , however , BMW intends to implement major changes to designs and marketing strategies to suit the U.S. market . Unlike its smaller predecessors , the MINI Countryman was the first subcompact crossover SUV for the brand . Future MINIs are expected to go in similar directions . BMW are also expected to produce a fully electric model to compete in the growing electric vehicle market .
