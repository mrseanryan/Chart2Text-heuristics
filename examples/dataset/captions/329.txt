Seven files belong to stolen property and items , and 14 belong to persons , including the National Sex Offender Register , Missing Person , and Identify Theft . It works alongside federal , tribal , state , and local agencies . The NCIC 's goal is to maintain a centralized information system between local branches and offices , so information is easily accessible nationwide .
