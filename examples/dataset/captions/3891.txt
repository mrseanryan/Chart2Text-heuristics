Sponsorship spending on the National Football League ( NFL ) and its teams has increased annually since 2010 , reaching 1.39 billion U.S. dollars worldwide during the 2018 season . Nike is one of the league 's main sponsors , providing uniform and apparel to all 32 NFL teams since 2012 – the two parties agreed a long-term extension to their rights partnership in 2018 . Why are sponsorship deals worth so much ? Sponsors are prepared to spend large amounts of money to get their brand displayed on big screens and pitch-side hoardings in stadiums across the NFL . Attracting the attention of supporters within the stadiums is one aim , but the primary motive for the investment is to have the brand exposed to the millions of TV viewers worldwide – the average television viewership of an NFL regular-season game in the United States during the 2018 season was around 16 million . Sports sponsorship across the U.S . The NFL is by far the most popular sport in terms of TV viewership in the United States : NFL games accounted for around 75 percent of the top 25 most-watched sporting events in the United States in 2018 . It is no surprise , then , that the NFL generates more money from sponsorship deals than both the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) and Major League Baseball ( MLB ) . Figures for the NBA increased significantly during the 2017 - 2018 season as it began allowing shirt sponsorship for the first time .
