When asked what they think are the most important issues the Netherlands is currently facing , 66 percent of survey respondents stated to worry about the climate and environment . Another 31 percent was concerned about health and social security . By comparison , relatively few people named the government debt or unemployment . Four percent considered terrorism as one of the main issues the country has to deal with . Concern about global warming Climate change is a top concern among all generations in the Netherlands . A 2018 poll in which respondents were asked whether they consider global warming problematic or not , over two thirds of respondents in all age groups stated to consider it ( very ) problematic . Concern was highest among those older than 55 years ( 78 percent ) , but among the participants younger than 35 years 67 percent also stated to consider climate change a problem . Fear of terrorist attacks Although relatively few people stated to consider terrorism one of the main issues , another 2019 survey found that terrorism is still something that worries a considerable amount of Dutch . Over 30 percent of survey participants answered to worry a lot about terrorism , whereas only 23 percent did not worry at all about it , or very little .
