Iconic U.S. national monument the Statue of Liberty was visited by 4.24 million people in 2019 , down from the previous year 's visitation figure by around two percent . Visitation reached a dramatic low in 2013 due to closure of the monument as a result of damage caused by Hurricane Sandy . A national treasure becomes a national monument The U.S. government granted the statue national monument status in 1924 . Around 10 years later it was entrusted to the care of the National Parks Service – it has remained in its care to this day . Along with Liberty Island , Ellis island ( famous for its past as a federal immigration station ) also joined as part of the Statue of Liberty National Monument . Since then , visitors to Ellis Island are included in the visitor count of The Statue of Liberty . Not the only popular attraction… The popularity of the Statue of Liberty is undeniable , with many other attractions not reaching similar visitation figures . One of these being Mount Rushmore ( South Dakota ) , which welcomed just below half the number of visitors of the Statue of Liberty in 2019 . That being said , the Lincoln Memorial ( Washington DC ) garnered almost double the number of visitors of the Statue of Liberty in the same year .
