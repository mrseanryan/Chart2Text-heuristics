Between 2008 and 2018 , the annual volume of concentrated milk produced in the Netherlands increased , from roughly 342 million kilograms to 344 million kilograms . Production peaked in 2015 , when the country produced nearly 408 million kilograms of concentrated or thickened milk . This specific type of milk is obtained by removing a part of the water , resulting in a thick milk which can be used to add to coffee or tea . The production in the Netherlands in this period was considerably higher than , for example , the production of concentrated milk in France Trade in concentrated milk A large share of the concentrated milk produced in the Netherlands is exported to other countries . In the last decade , concentrated milk exports grew considerably , reaching a value of just over 475 million euros in 2017 . That year , the import value of concentrated milk and cream was just a fraction of the export value , at roughly 126 million euros . By comparison , the export value of non-concentrated milk in the same period was nearly 841 million euros . Supplying dairy to the world In 2017 , dairy exports from the Netherlands amounted to just over 7.8 billion euros . The majority of the Dutch dairy exported was destined for other European countries . After Europe , the most important export markets were Asia and Africa . As the Netherlands exports far more dairy products than it imports , the country had a positive trade balance of 4.2 billion euros that year .
