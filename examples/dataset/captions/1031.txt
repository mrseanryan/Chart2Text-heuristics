Taking full advantage of the perks of the fantasy genre , J.R.R . Tolkien not only invented a whole universe , he also did not adhere to known age structures when he wrote The Lord of The Rings . The ages of his characters differ wildly ; Gollum is almost 600 years old , while Elrond , the elf , is several thousand years old , and Gandalf the Grey – and later the White – is immortal ( for display reasons , both are thus not mentioned here ) . One trilogy to rule them all Already an established literary success , the 2001 - 2003 The Lord of the Rings movie adaptations by Peter Jackson were also extremely successful at the box office and even won several Oscars . The third part in particular , The Return of the King , was very popular . There have been other adaptations of the trilogy , for radio , stage , and television , but none were ever that successful . There and back again After the immense success of The Lord of the Rings , Jackson then decided to also adapt the prequel . The Hobbit , which Tolkien had written as a children 's book and which is much shorter than The Lord of the Rings , was adapted into a trilogy as well and turned out to be equally successful in cinemas .
