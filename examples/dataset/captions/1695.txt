During the period between 1931 and 1960 , the number of live births in the United Kingdom peaked in 1947 , where there were estimated to have been over one million births . By contrast , the year with the least births was 1941 when there were just 695 thousand births . These two figures are undoubtedly linked to the Second World War , with 1941 coming just after the Battle of Britain and 1947 being two years after the end of the war . Talking ‘ bout the generations… Due to the higher number of births that occurred after the end of the Second World War , the so-called Baby Boomer Generation was still the largest in the United Kingdom as of 2015 . They numbered around 14.8 million people in this year , dwarfing both Generation X and Millennials of which there were 13 million and 13.8 million respectively . Comparisons with other times While there were certainly a lot of births in 1947 , the year with the highest number of births in twentieth century was 1920 when there were 1.1 million births . This came after a significant drop in the number of births that happened during the First World War , with every year prior to 1914 having over a million births . The 1960s was another period of relatively high births , but throughout the 1970s the figures fell and remained relatively low until the early 2010s .
