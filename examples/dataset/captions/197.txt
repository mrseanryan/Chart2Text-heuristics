While Costa Rica might have crashed out of the 2018 World Cup in the first round having finished bottom of their group , they were able to claim the title of the oldest average team . Their squad had an average age of 29.6 years , almost four years older than the squad of Nigeria , who had the youngest squad at the tournament . France 's stars bring home the trophyFrance 's squad was full of superstars such as Kylian Mbappé , Paul Pogba , and Antoine Griezmann , making it the most expensive squad assembled at the 2018 World Cup . The stars did not fail to deliver , winning the World Cup final 4 - 2 against Croatia . This marked France 's second World Cup title , following the title they won at their home World Cup in 1998 . Interestingly , the captain of the 1998 squad , Didier Deschamps , tasted success again in 2018 as he was the coach of the title-winning French team . With an annual salary of 3.5 million U.S. dollars , Deschamps was one of the best-paid managers at the 2018 World Cup , beaten only by Germany 's Joachim Löw , who boasted annual pay of 3.85 million U.S. dollars . Getting through the group stages a tall order ? With the World Cup being one of the highlights of the sporting calendar , it is no surprise that the players and squads are scrutinized to the finest detail . One of the more curious statistics is the average height of the players at the 2018 World Cup . Serbia 's squad towered over the rest with an average player height of 185.6 centimeters . By contrast , the smallest squad belonged to Saudi Arabia at an average of a comparatively diminutive 176.2 centimeters . As both teams failed to make it past the group stages , it seems that being of an average height was the recipe for success - France 's title winning squad measured up at a distinctly average 180.5 centimeters .
