As of 2014 , the electricity and heat production industry emits some 25 percent of all greenhouse gases produced worldwide , a higher share than any other industry . The transportation sector produces about 14 percent of the world 's greenhouse gasses . Greenhouse Gas Emissions in the United States There are several different types of gas emissions which have the potential to induce climate change , the most egregious of which are black carbon minimum and black carbon maximum . The good news is that greenhouse gas emissions in the United States have experienced a decrease between 2014 and 2017 , indicating that economic growth is not necessarily tied to emissions . In 2005 , over 7.34 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents were released into the atmosphere by the United States , and by 2017 this figure had dropped to 6.47 billion metric tons . Forests , for example , can act as a critical carbon sink but its capacity to take in carbon has been mitigated by deforestation and forest degradation . U.S. Renewable Energy Sector Renewable energy has the potential to significantly reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions currently released by fossil fuel combustion worldwide . In the United States , conventional hydroelectric power is the leading source of renewable energy , though in recent years wind power and solar/photovoltaics have played larger roles in the energy sector than ever before . In 2018 , about 712.8 billion kilowatt hours of power from renewable sources was generated in the United States , up from 686.6 billion kilowatts hours in the previous year .
