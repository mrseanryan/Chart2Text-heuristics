The statistic shows the global death toll due to earthquakes from 2000 to 2015 . Around 9,624 people died worldwide in 2015 as a result of earthquakes . Earthquakes Earthquakes are typically caused by the movement of the earth crusts . These movements cause vibrations which pass through and around the world . Earthquake Early Warning systems use seismic networks to detect earthquakes very rapidly so that these warnings can protect peoples ' lives . Nevertheless , an earthquake may cause injury and death . According to the U.S. Geological Survey , over 316,000 people were killed in the earthquake in Haiti in 2010 . With a total number of 3,000 killed people , the earthquake in San Francisco on April 18 , 1906 is the earthquake that caused the most fatalities within the United States . The number of fatalities includes people killed by earthquakes and resulting fires in San Francisco . The global number of deaths due to earthquakes varies from year to year . In 2010 , about 320,120 people died as a result of earthquakes worldwide . In 2012 earthquakes only caused 768 fatalities . The world 's strongest earthquake in the time period from 1990 and 2013 , according to measurement in the Richter scale , was the earthquake in Chile in 1960 . With a magnitude of 9.5 this earthquake is the highest ranked earthquake . The Richter scale helps to quantify the energy released by an earthquake . The magnitude of 9.0 and higher is defined as â€˜ Near or at total destruction - severe damage or collapse to all buildings . Heavy damage and shaking extends to distant locations . Permanent changes in ground topography . Death toll usually over 50,000 . '
