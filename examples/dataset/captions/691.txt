In 2018 , the United States accounted for 15.2 percent of global gross domestic product ( GDP ) after adjusting for purchasing power parity ( PPP ) . This share was expected to decrease to 13.86 percent by 2024 , which is roughly a seventh of the global total . What is PPP ? The easiest way to understand purchasing power parity is the Big Mac Index , a measure developed by The Economist . The index tracks the price of the McDonald 's Big Mac burger , sold at each of its thousands of restaurants worldwide . Countries where the Big Mac is most expensive have higher purchasing power , meaning one can buy more for each unit of that currency . To calculate PPP , economists use a group of goods to calculate the ratio of the price of this group in each country . This ratio is then used to convert all countries into a standardized price level , on parity with each other . Why use PPP ? A U.S. dollar in the United States does not have the same purchasing power as a dollar in China , even after considering the exchange rate . For this reason , adjusting for PPP gives an idea of what the rest of the world could buy in the United States , if prices were the same as in their home country . However , some economists argue that using PPP for comparisons between countries is inaccurate because it changes the price level differently for each country . Still , because it accounts not only for country-specific effects but also inflation and exchange rate fluctuations , PPP is a very popular metric .
