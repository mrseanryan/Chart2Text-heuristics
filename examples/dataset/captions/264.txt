Over the past 30 years , the birth rate in the United States has been steadily declining , and in 2018 , there were 11.6 births per 1,000 of the population . In 1990 , this figure stood at 16.7 births per 1,000 of the population . Demographics have an impact The average birth rate in the U.S. may be falling , but when broken down along ethnic and economic lines , a different picture is painted : Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander women saw the highest birth rate in 2018 among all ethnicities , and White and Asian women both saw the lowest birth rate . Additionally , the higher the family income , the lower the birth rate ; families making between 15,000 and 24,999 U.S. dollars annually had the highest birth rate of any income bracket in the States . Fewer births , but longer lives While the birth rate may be declining in the U.S. , lives are getting longer , and the life expectancy was estimated to be about 78.54 years in 2017 . While this is a positive aspect of today 's modern medical advances , countries such as the U.S. will have to find ways to support and deal with aging populations with fewer working-age adults .
