Indonesia was ranked first in the number of Facebook users among Southeast Asian countries in 2017 . While this is mainly due to the population size , it also reflects the increasing popularity and widespread use of social media in Indonesia . Hence , it is not surprising that , as of 2018 , the penetration rate of the other major social media platforms in Indonesia was on a high level too . Is Facebook still on the rise ? The social network giant reported 2.32 billion monthly users for its services Facebook , Facebook Messenger , WhatsApp and Instagram as of 2018 . Most of the members visited these platforms at least once a day , and Facebook was still accounting for a steady user increase . However , growth was already stagnating in the US , Canada and Europe . New users were mostly generated by India , Indonesia and the Philippines , which in turn makes these regions particularly important . Did the privacy scandal impact on the revenue ? As of 2018 , the negative impacts of the various scandals involving privacy violations were not noticeable in the turnover . In 2018 Facebook was able to increase its revenue per user to almost 25 U.S. dollars , whereas the total revenue rose to 55.8 billion dollars , most of which was generated through mobile ads . Sales in this area increased by almost 16 billion U.S. dollars in 2018 compared to the previous year . It remains to be seen how such scandals will impact Facebook as a multibillion-dollar company .
