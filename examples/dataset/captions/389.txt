This statistic shows the worldwide production of grain in 2018/19 , sorted by type . In that year , worldwide rye production came to about 12.38 million metric tons . The most important grain was corn , based on a production amount of over 1.09 billion metric tons . Grain Humans have been harvesting the small , dry seeds known as grain for thousands of years . The two main categories of grains are cereals , such as wheat , rye , and corn , and legumes , such as beans , lentils , peanuts and soybeans . Many grains are capable of being stored for long periods of time , easily transported over long distances , processed into flour , oil , and gas , and consumed by animals and humans . Most grain in the U.S. is used as animal feed , while slightly less is converted into ethanol . The smallest portion is consumed by humans . There has been recent debate about the health and ethics of grain feeding animals such as cows , goats , and sheep , animals biologically better suited to consuming grass . Though more cost effective than grass feeding , some argue this practice has an adverse effect on the quality of the meat as well as on the health of the animal and the consumer . The use of grains in producing ethanol has increased significantly in recent years . Global ethanol production has tripled since the year 2000 . Ethanol is a semi-renewable energy formed by the fermentation of a feedstock , often sugar cane or corn cobs . It can be mixed with gasoline and used as motor vehicle fuel . This hybrid motor fuel emits fewer pollutants than standard gasoline .
