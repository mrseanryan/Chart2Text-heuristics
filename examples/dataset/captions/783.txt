Lennar Corp , a home construction company headquartered in Miami Florida , was the leading home builder by gross revenue in the United States in 2018 . They earned 18.8 billion U.S. dollars in that year . Lennar Homebuilding was their most profitable segment in terms of revenue in 2018 . Residential construction is on the rise The number of private housing units started fell around the time of the global financial crisis ( 2007 - 2009 ) , but has since recovered â€“ though not to the heights of 2006 . Home construction expenditure has been steadily increasing since 2011 . This trend is set to continue through 2022 , which indicates that the revenues earned by home construction companies , such as D.R . Horton , will also continue to increase . New home sales follow the same trend Unsurprisingly , the number of new houses sold follows the same pattern . The property crash of 2008 , which was a leading factor in the global financial crisis at that time , impacted residential property sales in the United States . However , this market has also recovered since then and has been on the rise since 2011 . The number of homes started began to increase from 2009 onwards , but the increase in home sales did n't commence until two years later . This time lag is logical , as buyers often lack confidence in the property market after such a catastrophic incident as a property crash .
