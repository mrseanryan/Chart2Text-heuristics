In 2017 , Burkina Faso had the highest unemployment rate in the world , at 77 percent . This means that for every 100 members of the workforce , 77 did not have jobs at the time of the survey . Of the 20 countries in this statistic , each had a ratio of more than 1 in 4 workers without a job . What exactly is unemployment ? The unemployment rate is the number of people in the workforce divided by the number of people looking for jobs but not working . This number does not include students and retirees , because they are not looking for work . It also does not include people who have given up on finding a job , called discouraged workers . Youth unemployment can be particularly troubling because a gap in employment early in a person 's career leads to lower wages for that person 's entire life . Causes of unemployment in less developed countries A major driver in unemployment in these countries is conflict . In particular , internally displaced persons ( IDPs ) want to work , but moving to another part of the country disrupts their business network and moves them into a local economy with different labor demand . Countries with low levels of economic development , as roughly indicated by a low GDP per capita , often have fewer labor market opportunities , leading to high unemployment rates .
