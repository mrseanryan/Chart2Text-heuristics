The infant mortality rate is the number of deaths of babies under the age of one per 1,000 live births . There are many causes for infant mortality , which include birth defects , low birth weight , pregnancy complications , and sudden infant death syndrome . In order to decrease the high rates of infant mortality , there needs to be an increase in education and medicine so babies and mothers can receive the proper treatment needed . Maternal mortality is also related to infant mortality . If mothers can attend more prenatal visits and have more access to healthcare facilities , maternal mortality can decrease , and babies have a better chance of surviving in their first year .
