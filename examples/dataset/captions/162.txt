This statistic displays the annual exchange rate ( average or standardized measure ) of the euro to the British pound sterling ( EUR GBP ) , according to data provided by the European Central Bank , from the introduction of the euro in 1999 up until 2019 . The average ( standardized ) measure presents the calculation , which is based on many observations throughout the period in question . This is different than an annual measure at a point in time ; the annual measure presents concrete values as of the end of the year . Between the years of 2000 and 2009 , the average annual exchange rate of the euro to the British pound sterling noted a steep increase . In 2009 , the euro to British pound sterling annual average exchange rate was equal to 0.89 , which meant that one euro could buy 0.89 British pounds . By 2016 , this value had decreased , to a value of 0.82 , which again meant that one euro could buy 0.88 British pounds . The Brexit referendum can be seen as the likely reason for the noted increase in value of euro to British pound sterling in 2017 . Following the referendum result , in June 2016 , the monthly exchange rate increased and continued to do so for the majority of the rest of the year .
