England captain , Harry Kane , won the Golden Boot at the 2018 World Cup in Russia , having scored a total of six goals . Three of the Tottenham Hotspur striker 's goals came in England 's 6 - 1 defeat of Panama in the group stages . His final goal of the tournament came in England 's round of 16 game against Columbia where he opened the scoring from the penalty spot . England went on to win that game on penalties but were eventually knocked out by Croatia in the semi-finals . World Cup hotshotsHarry Kane was the first England player to win the Golden Boot at the World Cup since Gary Lineker at the 1986 World Cup in Mexico . In that tournament , England were knocked out in the quarter-finals by eventual champions , Argentina , captained by Diego Maradona . Somewhat surprisingly , the Argentinian legend does not feature in the top 20 leading goalscorers at the World Cup . Alone at the top of this list is Germany 's Miroslav Klose , who scored his sixteenth and record-breaking goal in Germany 's semi-final matchup with Brazil at the 2014 World Cup . France take home the trophyThere were five players all joint second on the top goalscorer list in 2018 . Unsurprisingly , two of those players , Antoine Griezmann and Kylian Mbappé , were part of the title-winning French squad . Indeed , both players got on the scoresheet in the final as France beat Croatia 4 - 2 to take home the trophy . With so much fire power in the French team , it is no wonder that the squad had a combined transfer value of almost 1.1 billion euros . Both Mbappé and Griezmann also made the top 10 list of most valuable players at the 2018 World Cup . Top of this list was Argentina 's Lionel Messi , with a market value of approximately 180 million euros .
