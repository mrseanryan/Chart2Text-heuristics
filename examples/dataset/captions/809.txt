Iran 's inflation rate rose sharply to 30.49 percent in 2018 and was projected to rise another six percentage points before slowly starting to decline . Given the recent sanctions by the United States regarding the nuclear deal , this number has both political and economic implications . Political implications President Hassan Rouhani won the 2017 election based on economic promises , many stemming from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action ( JCPOA ) , commonly known as the Iran Nuclear Deal . Lifting these sanctions opened the Iranian economy to many opportunities , including the chance to benefit from increased oil exports . The JCPOA was an integral part of the Rouhani campaign , so any economic hardship that is linked to the deal will likely be blamed on the president . Economic implications High inflation leads to high interest rates , which leads to less borrowing . Less borrowing means less investment , which slows economic growth . This slower growth often leads to higher inflation , which is what economists call an inflationary spiral . As such , Iran will have difficulty achieving substantial GDP growth until inflation returns to manageable rates .
