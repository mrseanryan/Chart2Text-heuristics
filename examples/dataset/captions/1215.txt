This statistic shows the number of planned nuclear reactors worldwide as of May 2019 , by country . There were two nuclear power reactors planned in Iran . The Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant is the first nuclear power plant operating here . Nuclear reactors planned worldwideAs of May 2019 , China and Russia have the largest number of planned nuclear reactors , totaling 43 and 24 reactors , respectively . Globally , both countries have a relatively high number of functioning nuclear reactors compared to other nations . In May 2019 , the United States reported the highest number of functioning reactors , namely 98 , followed by France with 58 reactors . In 2017 , almost 72 percent of France 's electricity production was generated by nuclear power . About 40 percent of France 's population believes that nuclear energy use has more disadvantages than advantages . Formerly called atomic piles , nuclear reactors are used to start and control a nuclear chain reaction in power plants . The heat from the reaction is transferred to a working fluid which in turn , runs through turbines for both electricity generation and ship propulsion . Nuclear reactors can also be used in the creation of isotopes for medical or industrial purposes , as well as for weapons production . Early efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation began with government secrecy and have since evolved under the International Atomic Energy Agency founded by the United Nations . Nuclear reactor construction was much more widespread in the 1970s and peaked in 1976 , when 42 reactors were being built globally . In 2017 , there were four nuclear reactor construction starts worldwide . As of 2017 , most operating reactors around the world have been running for 30 years or even longer .
