Since 1990 , the employment rate of women in the United States has stayed more or less steady . In 1990 , the female employment rate was 54.3 percent , and in 2018 , the employment rate was at 55.4 percent . However , it reached a peak in 2000 at 57.5 percent . Women in the workforce Women in the workforce have historically not been treated the same way as men . There are many inequalities in all aspects of work , from salaries to promotion , although worldwide , the number of women joining the workforce has been increasing . Women were originally relegated to being stay-at-home wives and mothers who were supposed to take care of the household while men worked . For a long time , women were not able to attend university , which barred them from gaining an education and a professional job . However , as society developed , women have been granted equal access to university . Despite this , the unemployment rate of women in the United States has fluctuated significantly since 1990 . In 2017 , Minnesota was the state with the highest percentage of women participating in the civilian labor force . The wage gap Today , the wage gap is still a problem for women , but has improved from years past . The wage gap is where women are paid less for doing the same job as men , despite having the same level of education and experience . One of the industries that saw the most disparity in pay between men and women in the United States was the finance and insurance industry .
