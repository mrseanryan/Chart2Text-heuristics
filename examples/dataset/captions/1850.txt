In 2020 , the price of West Texas Intermediate ( WTI ) crude oil is expected to reach 59.25 U.S. dollars per barrel , a slight increase from the year before . Also known as Texas light sweet , WTI has both low density ( `` light '' ) and low sulfur content ( `` sweet ) , especially compared to other benchmark crude oils . What are benchmark crudes ? West Texas Intermediate is often used as a price reference point called a benchmark ( or `` marker '' ) crude . This category includes Brent crude from the North Sea , Dubai Crude as well as blends in the OPEC Reference Basket . WTI , Brent , and the OPEC Basket have tended to trade closely , but since 2011 , UK Brent has been selling at a higher spot price than WTI , largely due to increased oil production in the United States . What causes price volatility ? In 2008 , the average price of WTI peaked during the global financial crisis before dropping significantly in the next year . The prices of WTI followed a similar pattern when they surged in the years leading up to 2014 , and then abruptly fell again . Between 2008 and 2014 , the U.S. oil industry developed more economically viable methods to extract shale oil domestically , creating an oversupply known as the 2010s oil glut .
