Two of the most popular operating systems on the market are made by Google ( Android ) and Apple ( iOS ) who had a combined stake of over 90 percent of the smartphone market share worldwide at the end of 2016 . The popularity of the smartphone has risen immensely since Apple introduced its first iPhone in 2007 , with 43.5 percent of all Americans forecast to own an iPhone by 2016 .

The first smartphone to use the Android OS was the HTC Dream released in 2008 . Although numbers of people using this OS were low at first , it has since grown to be the most used operating system , with an estimated 107.7 million Americans projected to own an Android phone by 2016 .
