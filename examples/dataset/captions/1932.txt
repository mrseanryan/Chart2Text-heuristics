As of 2020 , there were 52 nuclear reactors under construction worldwide , with the majority being built in China . Comparatively , there were 186 nuclear reactors shut down permanently as of that year . The United States had permanently shut down 37 nuclear facilities as of February 2020 . The construction and planning of a new nuclear power reactor is essential to the safety and operation of the facility . Methodical planning in plant design , materials , and labor ensures the success of the nuclear project . The time required for the construction of nuclear reactors can vary largely . Future of Nuclear Reactors The majority of planned new nuclear capacity is set in Asia . The increased capacity is also being created through upgrading already existing plants . Many existing atomic reactors are over 30 years old , which may exceed or is close to exceeding the designed lifetime of the reactors . It is also possible to replace major reactor components and some countries have also renewed licenses to extend the lifetime of plants . Many regions with existing nuclear power programs have further plans to build new reactors .
