South Africa 's inflation has been quite stable for the past years , levelling off between 4.58 and 6.3 percent , and is in fact expected to stabilize at around 5 percent in the future . South Africa is a mixed economy , generating most of its GDP through the services sector , especially tourism . However , the country struggles with unemployment and poverty . Inflation who ? The inflation rate of a country is an important key factor to determine the country 's economic strength . It is calculated using the price increase of a defined product basket , containing goods and services on which the average consumer spends money throughout the year . They include , for example , expenses for groceries , clothes , rent , utilities , but also recreational activities , and raw materials ( e.g . gas , oil ) , as well as federal fees and taxes . Some of these goods are more volatile than others – food prices , for example , are considered less reliable . The European Central Bank aims to keep inflation at around two percent in the long run . What happened in 2016 ? In 2016 , South Africa 's inflation rate peaked at over 6.3 percent , and gross domestic product , and thus economic growth , took a hit , a sure indicator that something was affecting the country 's economic scaffolding : Low growth due to weak demand and an uncertain political future caused a crisis ; then-President Jacob Zuma 's alleged mismanagement and unstable reign steeped in controversy and criminal charges even caused the economy 's outlook to be downgraded by ratings agencies . Zuma was relieved of his office in 2018 – ever since , inflation , GDP , and economic growth seem to have stabilized .
