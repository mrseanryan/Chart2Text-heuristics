The Ballon d'Or is an annual football prize presented by France Football . The award , voted for by football journalists , is given to the male player who was deemed to have played the best football over the previous 12 months . Unsurprisingly , two of the greatest footballers of all time , Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo , top the list of all-time winners . Messi won the title for a record-breaking sixth time in 2019 , while Ronaldo sits just behind him in second place with five trophies to his name . Cristiano Ronaldo Portugal 's Cristiano Ronaldo won his first Ballon d'Or in 2008 when he was still playing for Manchester United . He was also voted the club 's player of the year that season and helped them to win three successive league titles between 2007 and 2009 . Manchester United remain the all-time leaders in number of English top flight wins , having taken home the trophy 20 times . Ronaldo subsequently won four Ballon d'Or trophies during his time at Real Madrid , where he won the Spanish league twice and the Champions League four times . Real Madrid have dominated the Champions League in recent years and took home the trophy four out of five times between 2013 and 2018 . They are by far the most successful team in European Cup history , having lifted the prestigious trophy a total of 13 times . Lionel Messi It is difficult to mention the successes of Cristiano Ronaldo without mentioning those of his rival , Lionel Messi . The Argentinian won the Ballon d'Or four years running between 2009 and 2012 and claimed the trophy twice more in 2015 and 2019 . Even as he enters the latter stages of his career , he remains one of the most valuable players on the planet and an integral part of both FC Barcelona and the Argentinean national team . He has won La Liga 10 times and has also been part of the winning Barcelona Champions League side four times , one short of Ronaldo 's tally .
