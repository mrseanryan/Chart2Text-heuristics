Deloitte generated the largest revenue in the United States of the Big Four accounting firms in 2018 , earning around 4.5 billion U.S dollars more than their nearest competitor PricewaterhouseCoopers ( PwC ) . The rankings mirror the worldwide performance of the Big Four firms , with Deloitte and PwC again competing for the top two positions . Deloitte 's operations in the Americas Deloitte reported revenue figures of around 22 billion U.S dollars for North and South America combined in 2018 , of which approximately 20 billion U.S. dollars came in revenues from the United States . In recent years , the performance of Deloitte in the United States has improved year-on-year - revenue increased by more than one billion U.S. dollars between 2017 and 2018 . The growing number of employees at Deloitte provides another indication of the firm 's stature throughout North and South America . Deloitte employed in excess of 139,000 staff members across the Americas in 2019 – an increase of 11 percent on the previous year – and of all the leading accounting firms in the United States , Deloitte employed by far the most members of staff . The Big Eight of the Eighties There are four major accounting firms in the world today : Deloitte , PricewaterhouseCoopers ( PwC ) , Ernst and Young ( EY ) , and Klynveld Peat Marwick Goerdeler ( KPMG ) . However , the professional accounting landscape was far different for much of the 20th century , with eight firms competing for the same major clients . The growth of multinational clients in a global economy changed the industry during the 1980s . In order to gain a strong foothold in the new international market , two mega mergers took place in 1989 that involved four of the Big Eight firms : Ernst and Whinney merged with Arthur Young to form Ernst and Young , and Deloitte Haskins and Sells merged with Touche Ross to form Deloitte and Touche . This was the start of the Big Eight gradually being reduced to the Big Four .
