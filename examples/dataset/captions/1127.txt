APM-Maersk had 17 ships in its order book as of March 2 , 2020 . Overall , the Copenhagen-headquartered shipper accounted for 17.6 percent of the world 's merchant container fleet . Fleet capacity APM-Maersk had ships with a capacity of around 4.2 million twenty-foot-equivalent units , which could be broken down to some 2.36 million twenty-foot-equivalent units of owned capacity and about 1.8 million twenty-foot equivalent units of chartered capacity . Furthermore , the container line had ships with an additional 39,864 twenty-foot-equivalent units of capacity in its order book at the end of the month . As of January 2020 , Maersk owned 314 ships , some 31 of which had a capacity in excess of 18,000 twenty-foot equivalent units . One of Maersk 's most impressive container ship is the Madrid MÃ¦rsk . The Triple-E vessel was built by South Korea 's Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Company , one of the largest shipbuilding companies worldwide . The megahauler is just under 400 meters long and 59 meters wide , trailing only the OOCL Hong Kong in TEU capacity . Triple-E stands for `` economies of scale '' , `` energy efficient '' and `` environmentally improved '' . The ships in the Triple-E class are regarded as the most efficient container ships per twenty-foot equivalent of cargo . However , the building of such mega ships comes at a risk as the container shipping-industry continues to suffer from overcapacity and weak global demand in times of rising trade tensions .
