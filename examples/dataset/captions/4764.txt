This statistic shows the degree of urbanization in Iceland from 2008 to 2018 . Urbanization means the share of urban population in the total population of a country . In 2018 , 93.81 percent of Iceland 's total population lived in urban areas and cities . The population of Iceland Iceland is currently 94 percent urban , making it the eighth most urban country in the world . However , even though the majority of the population lives in urban areas , the island itself is not densely populated . The population overwhelmingly lives in the nation 's capital and largest city , Reykjavik , which is located in the southwest corner of the island and is considered the northernmost national capital in the world . Reykjavik is only home to around 120,000 people and has more of a suburban feel to it than that of an urban metropolis . Reykjavik has become the home base for the country 's booming tourist industry for those who want to venture out to explore the island 's vast wilderness . In 2014 alone , there were around 4.4 million tourists who stopped on the island for a short stay ( 413264 ) . The two second largest cities , Kopavogur and Hafnarfjour , are also located very close to the capital , and are each home to around 30,000 people- significantly less than the population of Reykjavik . In total , the small island nation reports a population of around 330,000 people as of 2015 , and these figures are not likely to grow significantly in the future , as the fertility rate is less than the natural replacement rate and annual population growth is also low .
