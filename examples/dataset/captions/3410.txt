The average house rent price in the Netherlands reached a value of approximately 16 euros per square meter in the third quarter of 2019 . This was an increase of 3.6 percent compared to the previous year , an increase the source describes as `` rather moderate '' . This because housing prices tended to increase at much higher rates in 2019 . Note that the numbers shown in this statistic are not from a governmental institution , but concern rental housing being offered on the website of the source in the specific quarters . This implies the numbers only show rents of property on the free market and excludes social housing . No difference was made between the type of rental housing , such as houses , apartments , rooms or studios . Big cities well above the average rent price Cities in the Randstad area ( the areas surrounding Amsterdam , The Hague , Utrecht and Rotterdam ) have a big influence on the average rental price in the Netherlands . This is especially true for Amsterdam , as the Dutch capital registered an average rent price of roughly 23 euros per square meter at the end of 2019 . Utrecht ( 18 euros per square meter ) , The Hague and Rotterdam ( both around 16 euros ) were also well above the national average , but rents in these cities increased at a higher rate than in Amsterdam . Are these rents expensive or not ? A historical development of rent price indices suggests that rents in the Netherlands are at their highest level since 1990 . This graph , however , does not mention whether it has a correction for inflation or not . It is unclear whether any institution researched the development of `` real '' rent prices for the Netherlands . Statista can offer two components for a potential comparison : the annual housing rent percentage increase between 1990 and 2019 as well as the inflation rate of the Netherland from 2008 to 2018 .
