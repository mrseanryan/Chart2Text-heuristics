Since 1980 the U.S. birth rate for twins has risen significantly . As of 2018 the birth rate for twins in the U.S. was 32.6 per 1,000 live births . It is believed that an increase in the twin birth rate may be associated with an increased use of vitro fertilization and other assisted reproductive technologies in recent years . U.S. twin births Across the U.S. twin birth rates vary in a variety of ways . The U.S. states with the highest twin birth rates are Connecticut and the District of Columbia . Ethnicity is another factor to be considered when investigating the twin birth rate . Since 1980 the U.S. twin birth rate has increased among all ethnicities , however , it has increased more among non-Hispanic black mothers and less among Hispanic mothers . And finally , age is another important factor in twin birth rates . As of 2018 , mothers between the ages of 45 - 54 had the highest twin birth rates in the United States . Assisted reproductive technology Assisted reproductive technology ( ART ) is a treatment used to treat infertility among men and women . A common complication associated with ART is multiple births ( twins , triplets , etc. ) . In the U.S. , among all ART pregnancies the most common outcome was a single infant birth , followed by multiple infant births . Among all U.S. ART cycles ( including those that did not lead to pregnancy ) using non-donor eggs or embryos multiple-fetus pregnancy may be present in up to six percent of cases .
