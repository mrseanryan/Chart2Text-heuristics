The median age in Pakistan grew to 21.8 years in 2015 , meaning that half of the population was older than that , half younger . This figure was lowest in between 1975 and 2000 but is projected to rise to 30 years by 2050 . The meaning of age structure Pakistan has one of the largest populations worldwide , and this statistic presents the median age of that group . This suggests that millions of Pakistanis are too young to work and in need of education . At the same time , the rising life expectancy suggests that the median age will shift upward in the future in a way not predicted by the source . This could be due to different interpretations of infant mortality and other factors by differing sources . Economic implications Having a younger workforce can be a challenge for an economy in the short run . If the country can educate the youth , short-term spending can pay off when those youth become more productive workers . This investment can be costly , however , and Pakistan may not be able to finance this spending if its national debt is too high . The success of the youth depends largely on the country 's fiscal priorities , and this success will shape the country 's outcomes in the medium term .
