In the European Union , the number of companies in the business of textile and clothing manufacturing has ebbed and flowed over the period of time between 2009 and 2018 . In 2018 , the total number of textile and clothing manufacturers was recorded as 171,072 in EU28 countries , marking a loss of about 17,000 of them since 2009 . In contrast , the turnover figures of the industry demonstrated a consistently positive trend before peaking at 181 billion euros in 2017 . More emphasis on clothing manufacturing The EU textile industry is segmented predominantly into two markets : textiles and clothing . Clothing has a clearly bigger presence with the number of enterprises devoted to this sector , almost double the number of companies that manufacture textiles . Likewise , investments going into different segments of the industry highlights the primacy of clothing to textile manufacturing in EU28 . Industry employment declines Despite the rising turnover and EU investments in the manufacture of textiles , employment in this sector dropped significantly . While in 2009 over 2 million people were employed across all segments , in 2017 this number fell considerably .
