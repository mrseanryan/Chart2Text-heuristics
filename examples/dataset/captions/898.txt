The statistic represents the passenger load factor ( PLF ) of international flights in December 2019 , by region . In that month , the international passenger load factor in Europe stood at 83.5 percent . Passenger load factor When it comes to international passenger boardings , John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York ( JFK ) is the busiest airport in the United States , its most in-demand transatlantic route being the passage to London Heathrow ( LHR ) . Aircraft that are used on flight routes with a very high passenger demand require a high seating capacity to transport as many passengers as possible on board . The full utilization of an aircraft 's seating capacity is an effective measurement for airlines to increase revenue . To give an example , the largest Dreamliner variant seats up to 330 passengers , and the flight distance from John F. Kennedy airport to London Heathrow comes to around 3,450 miles . The passenger load factor is the quotient of the number of seat miles and passenger miles traveled . While seat miles are calculated by multiplying the number of seats on board with the number of miles travelled , passenger miles are the product of the amount of miles traveled and the number of passengers carried . A fully-seated Dreamliner traveling from JFK to LHR carries the same number of seat and passenger miles and thus has a passenger load factor of one . In other words , its seating capacity is fully utilized .
