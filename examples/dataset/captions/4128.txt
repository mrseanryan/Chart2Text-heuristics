The most valuable brand in 2019 in the United Kingdom was , by some distance , the British-Dutch oil and gas company Shell .

The second most valuable brand was the professional services firm EY ( Ernst & Young ) , followed in third place by another oil and gas company , BP . Telecommunications brands making waves Although two of the top three most valuable brands in the UK are oil and gas companies , it 's the telecommunications branch which is most represented . Vodafone , Sky , and BT all made the top ten , with 3 and O2 both just missing out . Banking on brand value Two bank brands made the top ten , HSBC and Barclays . When it comes to brand value , these two have been a cut above the rest for the last few years , with HSBC seeing an increase in brand value in 2019 compared to the previous year . Supermarket giant Tesco was the seventh most valuable brand . Land Rover was the only brand from the automotive sector , although they were n't considered one of the most valuable automotive brands worldwide .
