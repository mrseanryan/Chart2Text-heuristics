This statistic shows the degree of urbanization in Thailand from 2008 to 2018 . Urbanization means the share of urban population in the total population of a country . In 2018 , 49.95 percent of Thailand 's total population lived in urban areas and cities . The migration of the Thai population to metropolises and urban areas Thailand is in the midst of transforming itself from a predominantly rural country to an increasingly urban one . In as little as ten years , the country has shifted from 36 percent urban to almost 50 percent urban , which means that half of the population now lives in cities and urban areas . While Thailand 's urbanization rates are still low compared to other developed nations - which can reach levels of 80 - 90 percent - , this transformation in Thailand is still significant , especially as most of this growth occurs and is expected to occur in the Krung Thep area , better known as Bangkok , capital and largest city in Thailand . Krung Thep is now home to more than 5.7 million people . The number of tourists and overnight visitors to the city is also on the rise : In 2015 alone , the city had more than 18 million visitors . This development will place increasing demands on urban infrastructure , as the city grows and grows . The second largest city in Thailand is Nonthaburi , but it only has around one quarter of a million inhabitants , a significant difference . Despite the country 's rural but shifting population , Thailand 's fertility rate is low and below the natural replacement rate , and population growth in general is thus only minimal . Interestingly , despite this migration , agriculture has retained a stable share in GDP generation , actually increasing slightly over time , while the contributions of industry and services to GDP have also remained relatively the same .
