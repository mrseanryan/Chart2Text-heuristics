These regions are also the Italian regions with the highest number of inhabitants . For instance , in 2019 , Lombardy counted ten million inhabitants ( approximately one sixth of the total Italian population ) and was housing 17 thousand immigrants . The Mediterranean route to Europe Between January and October 2019 , almost seven hundred migrants died or went missing in the Italian Central Mediterranean Sea in the attempt to reach Europe . In 2019 , 11.5 thousand people arrived on the Italian shores . In fact , the number of migrants decreased over the last years . However , the death and missing cases did not drop in proportion to the number of people who reached the coast .
