Global gross domestic product Gross domestic product , also called GDP , is the market value of goods and services produced by a country in a certain time period . It is an important factor to evaluate the economic state of a country : the higher the GDP of a country , the better its economic state . Another important indicator is GDP per capita , which literally means `` GDP per person '' , but despite its name , it is not used to determine the standard of living in a country , as it does not reflect an individual 's personal income . Instead , it shows the theoretical distribution of a country 's GDP among its inhabitants at a certain point in time . Again , the higher the GDP per capita of a country , the better its economy is set . Global gross domestic product is a key indicator for global economy , which combines all individual economies worldwide . When looking at the gross domestic product / GDP of selected global regions , it is obvious that GDP is highest in industrialized countries . A look at the distribution of GDP of the main industrialized and emerging countries in selected countries shows that the United States ' GDP is the highest by far , followed by China and Japan . The United States , China and Japan are thus the largest economies in the world , followed by Germany . This status is reflected in their GDP per capita ; again , the United States lead this ranking , followed by Japan and Germany . When it comes to countries with the highest increase in GDP in comparison to the previous year , however , none of these countries are among the first few . This ranking is led by Libya , had quite a significant economic lead over the others .
