An undisputable winner in a ranking of the most expensive keywords on the Google AdWords platform is ‘ business services ' with a cost of 58.64 U.S. dollars per click . In second place was ‘ bail bonds ' _ , for which Google was earning just 16 cents less for clicks on searches for the keyword . CPC for the term ‘ casino ' ranked third , with a cost of 55.48 U.S. dollars . The least expensive keywords in the ranking were ‘ pest control ' _ , ‘ termite ' and ‘ plumber ' _ , all under 40 dollars per click . Is Google the king of search advertising ? It certainly seems that way , as the search engine was estimated to bring in more than 85 billion U.S. dollars from search advertising in 2017 , whilst Google 's Chinese equivalent and closest competitor , Baidu , generated search ad revenue eight times lower than that . Google has reigned over search advertising for longer than any of its competitors , with marketers investing the majority of their dollars in promoting products and services via either the display network or as text next to search engine results . However , nowadays , with the growing popularity of Amazon and their vast presence on the publishing scene , as well as Facebook 's enormous audience reach , Google 's kingdom is being challenged by the two platforms . What is more , the developing attraction towards using voice search among customers , and consequently among marketers who consider Amazon 's Alexa to have higher marketing value shows that Google needs to step up its game .
