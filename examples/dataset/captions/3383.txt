The average revenue per user ( ARPU ) of mobile broadband customers in Europe has fallen steadily since 2011 , reaching an estimated 14.8 euros per month in 2018 . This is a decrease of 22.9 percent on the ARPU generated in 2011 . Shrinking need for mobile broadband The decline of mobile broadband , as demonstrated by the falling ARPU and the diminishing penetration rate in countries such as the United Kingdom ( UK ) , can partially be attributed to the increased speeds and reliability that comes with 3G and 4G mobile networks . Instead of relying on a dongle or datacard , users can connect directly from their phone , or connect a laptop to the internet using a mobile device to create a tethered connection . One sign of this phenomenon is the increased volume of data consumed by mobile users in many regions . In March 2011 , the average monthly mobile data used per active SIM card in Great Britain ( GB ) reached .11 gigabytes . By June 2017 , average data volumes increased to 1.9 gigabytes per active British SIM card .5G on the horizon 5G is the primary tech that looks set to change how we connect in the future . Offering peak speeds up to 20x faster than 4G and a much greater maximum bandwidth , 5G should revolutionize mobile data not just for consumers , but for a range of commercial and industrial applications . By 2025 , it is expected that the number of 5G connections will grow to 1.1 billion worldwide .
