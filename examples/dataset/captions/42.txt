In 2018 Germany 's share of total contributions to the budget of the European Union was 20.78 percent , the highest of any EU member state . Only three other member states contributed more than ten percent to the EU budget , France ( 15.58 percent ) the United Kingdom ( 11.88 percent ) and Italy ( 11.74 percent ) . The small island-nation of Malta contributed the least to the EU budget , at 0.08 percent . Largest economies in Europe The amount which EU member states contribute to the EU budget is heavily linked to the size of its economy . Germany , for example , has the largest economy in the whole of Europe , with Gross domestic product reaching almost 3.4 trillion Euros in 2018 . Britain and France have the second and third largest economies in Europe with GDPs of 2.39 and 2.35 trillion euros respectively . UK Rebate The amount which the United Kingdom contributes to the European Union budget was a key issue during the Brexit referendum of 2016 . Prior to the referendum , the `` Leave '' campaign famously claimed that the UK sends the EU 350 million British pounds a week , a figure which omitted the rebate which the UK receives from the EU as well as public sector receipts . As of 2018 , the UK contributed approximately 8.93 billion to the EU budget and received 8.52 billion back .
