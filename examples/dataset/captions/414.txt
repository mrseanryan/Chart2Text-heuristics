During 2018 , Paris was the most expensive European city to rent an Apartment , at 2.85 thousand U.S. dollars per month . London had an average rental cost of over 300 U.S. dollars less than the Capital of France . Cities within Western Europe have a higher rental price than their Eastern counterparts with Moscow seeing the average cost of rent over one thousand U.S. dollars per month lower than Paris . Supply and demand One of the main factors driving high rents across European cities is the same as any other consumer driven business . If demand outweighs supply , prices will inflate . The drive for high paid professionals to be located centrally in prime locations , mixed with the low levels of available space , high land and , construction costs all help keep rental prices increasing . Renters now outweigh home owners In London , the number of private renters has increased dramatically from 2008 . Increasing house prices as well as standard costs of living have seen more and more people unable to get on to the property ladder , and are therefore forced onto the rental markets for longer . This being said 2019 has become a great time for first-time buyers as interest rates remained historically low .
