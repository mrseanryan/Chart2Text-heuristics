About 33 percent of U.S. physicians spent 17 - 24 minutes with their patients , according to a survey conducted in 2018 . Physicians are often constrained in their time directly working with patients , which could have an impact on patient care outcomes . Studies found out that physicians spend almost half of their time in office on data entry and other desk work . More sophisticated , network-enabled EHR ( electronic health records ) systems for physicians could probably be a step towards more time directly with patients . U.S. physicians Physicians work in a variety of fields and across direct patient care and research . Within the last 50 years , the total number of active physicians has increased dramatically throughout the United States . Among all U.S. states , including the District of Columbia , the District of Columbia had the highest rate of all U.S. states of active physicians . Physician time In a recent study , physicians were asked about the time they spend with their patients . According to the results , a majority of physicians said that they felt their time with patients was limited . In 2018 , most physicians saw 11 - 20 patients per day . Some reports have estimated that for every hour of direct patient contact , physicians spend an additional 2 hours working on reporting and desk work . Recent physician surveys have also indicated that one of the primary reasons for physician burn-out is having too many bureaucratic tasks .
