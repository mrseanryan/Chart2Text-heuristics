This statistic shows U.S. shale gas production between 1999 and 2017 , with projections until 2050 . In 2050 , the United States is expected to produce around 35.24 trillion cubic feet of shale gas . According to the source , shale gas refers to natural gas that is trapped within shale formations . U.S. shale gas production - additional information The production of shale gas in the United States has increased dramatically since 2000 from about 300 billion cubic feet to 16.54 trillion cubic feet in 2016 , and is expected to reach about 33.4 trillion cubic feet in 2050 . Shale gas is a natural gas found within shale formations , a type of fine-grained sedimentary rock . High oil and gas prices , as well as recent developments in oil and gas extraction - like horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing ( fracking ) - have made shale gas economically viable to produce . WTI crude oil prices is now about 59.9 U.S. dollars and its price fluctuations may heavily impact the fracking boom . It is expected that shale gas production will be concentrated primarily in regions such as Northeastern United States and the Gulf Coast , reaching some five trillion cubic feet and 4.4 trillion cubic feet , respectively , of production in 2035 . Direct income from shale gas production-related labor is also expected to increase in the next few decades , reaching 41.9 billion U.S. dollars by 2035 . The vast presence of U.S. shale gas production will allow for continued domestic use of natural gas . The Huron Shale , located in Kentucky , West Virginia , and Virginia cost approximately 1.7 million U.S. dollars , comparatively , Mexico 's Mexico Shale cost about 15.1 million U.S. dollars . However , the process of fracking has become a widely debated issue due to its environmental impacts , most notably , its water usage and its impact on aquatic ecosystems . In the United Kingdom , almost half of the citizens believed that using fracking to extract shale gas would eventually have a positive effect on the nation 's economy .
