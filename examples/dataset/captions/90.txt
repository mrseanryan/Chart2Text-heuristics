Youth unemployment rate in EU member states Unemployment is a crucial economic factor for a country ; youth unemployment is often examined separately because it tends to be higher than unemployment in older age groups . It comprises the unemployment figures of a country 's labor force aged 15 to 24 years old ( i.e . the earliest point at which mandatory school education ends ) . Typically , teenagers and those in their twenties who are fresh out of education do not find jobs right away , especially if the country 's economy is experiencing difficulties , as can be seen above . Additionally , it also tends to be higher in emerging markets than in industrialized nations . Worldwide , youth unemployment figures have not changed significantly over the last decade , nor are they expected to improve in the next few years . Youth unemployment is most prevalent in the Middle East and North Africa , even though these regions report high unemployment figures regardless ( Zimbabwe and Turkmenistan are among the countries with the highest unemployment rates in the world , for example ) , and are also highly populated areas with a rather weak infrastructure , compared to industrialized regions . In the European Union and the euro area , unemployment in general has been on the rise since 2008 , which is due to the economic crisis which caused bankruptcy and financial trouble for many employers , and thus led to considerable job loss , less job offerings , and consequently , to a rise of the unemployment rate . Older workers are struggling to find new jobs despite their experience , and young graduates are struggling to find new jobs , because they have none . All in all , the number of unemployed persons worldwide is projected to rise , this is not down to the economic crisis alone , but also the industrial automation of processes previously performed by workers , as well as rising population figures .
