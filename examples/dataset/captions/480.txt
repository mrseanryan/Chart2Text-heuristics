The 222 million euro transfer of Brazilian player Neymar from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain ( PSG ) in August 2017 is the all-time highest fee for a soccer transfer . The transfers of Philippe Coutinho to Barcelona and Kylian Mbappe to PSG are second and third in the list respectively.The rise of the big-money transfer The transfer of Neymar to PSG shocked the soccer world : it was more than twice as much as the previous record of 105 million euros that Manchester United paid Juventus for Paul Pogba . The transfer was made possible by the owners of PSG , Qatar Sports Investments , who have provided significant funds to strengthen the playing squad since their acquisition of the club in 2011 . The Neymar transfer created a domino effect that saw recipients Barcelona spend a total of 265 million euros on Ousmane Dembele and Philippe Coutinho during the 2017/2018 season â€“ both signings feature in the top five all-time highest transfer fees . In fact , eight of the top ten highest transfer fees have happened since the summer of 2017 , highlighting the growing sums of money being made in revenue by clubs within the top European soccer leagues.The evolution of the transfer record Mega-money moves have been taking place in soccer throughout the years . Spanish giants Real Madrid have been known to splash the cash , notably breaking the transfer record to sign Zinedine Zidane in 2001 ( 75 million euros ) , Cristiano Ronaldo in 2009 ( 94 million euros ) , and Gareth Bale in 2013 ( 100 million euros ) . It could be some time before a fee eclipses the 222 million euros that PSG paid for Neymar , but if the transfer record is to be broken in the future , an English Premier League team could be the most likely to do so : the English Premier League generates the most revenue of the biggest European soccer leagues .
