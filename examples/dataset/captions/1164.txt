Inflation in Zimbabwe rose to 10.6 percent in 2018 , and is projected to jump dramatically to 161.81 percent in 2019 . After that , estimates predict a 3 percent equilibrium for now - however , given Zimbabwe 's history of poor monetary policy , including one of the worst instances of hyperinflation , this seems unrealistic . Inflation history Inflation depends significantly on economic expectations of it , making it hard to reduce inflation once it has hit higher levels . This happened in Zimbabwe in the years approaching 2008 , at the end of which a single U.S. dollar was worth over 2.6 trillion Zimbabwe dollars , up from 10,000 Zimbabwe dollars at the start of 2005 . This all but destroyed Zimbabwe 's economy , leading to very low gross domestic product ( GDP ) per capita and a government struggling to finance itself . The way ahead In 2009 , the Zimbabwean dollar had twelve zeros slashed from the banknotes . This was not enough , and after three decades of rule , former Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe was removed from power at the end of 2017 . Citizens of the country are trying to hold foreign banknotes ; they prefer U.S. dollars or euros , but the South African rand is more common . However , the rand 's performance against other currencies has been lackluster in recent years . This underscores the struggle that the Zimbabwean people have to find a stable currency at the moment .
