The Eurostar high-speed train brings passengers from one side of the Channel , which separates the United Kingdom from Continental Europe , to the other . Much to the pleasure of the passengers heading to or departing from the Lille Railway station , this train registered a rate of delay ( of more than half an hour ) of 0 percent , making it one of the most punctual European trains in 2016 . Eurostar has a high perception in the UK Usually , the high volume of passengers combined with the long distances covered by this train , could signify a decrease in the quality of the service provided . But this does n't seem to be the case for the Eurostar group . As of June 2018 , the Eurostar group had a BrandIndex value of 14.7 making it the second-highest rated transport service provider in the United Kingdom . It is important to notice that this index is calculated by taking the average of Impression , Quality , Satisfaction and Reputation . Travelling with the Eurostar is usually more expensive In 2016 , the high-speed trains and the Shuttle belonging to the Eurostar group transported roughly 20 million passengers . Yet , the high-prices for short-distance travels as the London-Paris route , seem to drive many passengers to favoring other less expensive ways of travelling . For instance , the Irish low-cost airline , Ryanair , offers a flight from London Luton to NÃ®mes ( in the South of France ) . Between 2016 and 2017 , Ryanair transported around 120 million passengers , around a twelvefold of the number of passengers transported by the Eurostar in 2016 . This airline also achieved an annual revenue of roughly 6.6 billion euros .
