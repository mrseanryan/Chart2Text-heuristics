This statistic represents worldwide electricity consumption between 1980 and 2016 . In 2016 , the world 's electricity consumption amounted to approximately 21.8 trillion kilowatt hours . One quadrillion watts is approximately equal to one petawatt . Global consumption of electricityGlobal consumption of electricity has increased over the last decades from 7,323 terawatt hours in 1980 to 21.8 terawatt hours in 2016 In a similar pattern , power consumption in China has quickly risen , reaching 6,840 terawatt hours in 2018China is the highest consumer of electricity in the world with the United States following close behind , consuming 4,148 terawatt hours in 2016 . Generally , countries with larger populations consume more energy . However , Canada was one of the highest consumers of electricity at 538 terawatt hours , despite having a population of about 36 million inhabitants . Per capita consumption of electricity can vary widely due to electricity rates , appliances penetration , market saturation , and heating and cooling . Electricity consumption tends to be smaller than the amount of electricity generated due to several factors , such as grid and storage losses and self-consumption from power plants . However , cogeneration power plants are able to use energy that is often wasted in forms of heat or energy for industrial processes . In Alberta , Canada , electric cogeneration energy production accounted for 25 terawatt hours . Currently it is estimated that over 20 percent of the world 's electricity generation is derived from renewable sources . In the United States , about almost 275 billion kilowatt hours of electricity was generated from wind power in 2018 .
