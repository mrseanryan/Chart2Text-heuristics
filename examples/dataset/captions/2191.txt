In 2019 , 0.89 percent of the loans that banks in the United States held were non-performing . This means that 99 percent of loan recipients were repaying their bank back at that time , which is a significant improvement from the 5.3 percent of non-performing loans in the aftermath of the Financial Crisis . What are non-performing loans ? Banks do not expect all the loans they issue to be fully repaid . For this reason , part of the interest rate that they charge is a `` risk premium '' , a higher interest rate than the expected change in value . Banks generally use the interest rate on U.S. short-term government bonds as the `` risk free rate '' , then increase that rate based on the borrower 's credit score . Loans and delinquency Non-performing loans differ by loan types based on collateral . Collateralized loans are loans in which the lender has taken something to ensure repayment . If repayment does not occur , the lender keeps the collateral . A classic example would be taking jewelry to a pawn shop , but the same principle applies to mortgage foreclosures . Loans without collateral differ in that a bank can not foreclose on student loan debt or a medical procedure .
