This statistic shows the number of people employed in the coal mining industry in the United Kingdom ( UK ) from 1920 to 2018 . Once a major powerhouse of the UK 's economy , the coal industry was the lifeblood of several regions , providing employment for more than one million workers . Since that time , shifting attitudes towards coal and the emergence of alternative energy sources such as wind and solar have seen coal 's role in the UK 's energy mix diminish in recent years . There are fewer coal mines in operation , and the price of coal has fallen , making the production and consumption of coal a less attractive prospect than it used to be . Each of these factors has lead to the coal industry contracting , and the loss of coal mining jobs . With the exception of South and Central America , and the Asia Pacific region , most regions around the world saw a drop in coal consumption . North America , for example , reported a decline of 6 percent from 2017 to 2018 . The shrinking number of jobs has not been isolated to the UK , with a similar reductions seen in the United States .
