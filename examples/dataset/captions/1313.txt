The European Union is the main export destination for passenger cars exported by the United Kingdom . In 2018 , every second car sold by UK based manufacturers went to other member states of the EU.Total exports by the UK to the EU valued at 172.21 billion British pounds that same year , accounting for 45 percent of all UK exports and making the EU its most important trading partner . In recent years the discrepancy between exports and imports has exacerbated the UK 's negative trade balance with the EU . This was largely due to a fall in exports recorded between 2011 and 2015 . Motor industry contribution In 2018 , the UK motor industry contributed 18.6 billion British pounds to the economy . It was the second year in a row that industry revenue declined , with 2016 being the peak year when contributions amounted to 22 billion British pounds . Car production volumes The decline in economic contribution is a direct result of a decrease in production output . In 2018 , some 1.52 million passenger cars were manufactured . This was nine percent less than the volume produced the previous year and on a level with figures reported for 2013 .
