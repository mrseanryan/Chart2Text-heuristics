Treasury securities are U.S. government debt , bonds sold to finance the United States government . Since the United States is seen as a guaranteed investment , these bonds are often used by large financial firms as collateral . The yield on a Treasury bond is minimal , but these institutions often do not hold them until maturity , instead trading them on secondary market . Other options The federal funds rate is the rate the Federal Reserve charges banks for overnight loans . Other assets , such as mortgaged backed securities , can also be used like treasury securities . Mortgage backed securities are bundles of home loans packaged together . Such bundling makes the overall security safer , unless there is a systemic shock to the housing market which would undermine the entire package .
