The statistic shows the consumption of coal energy for electricity generation in the United States between 1950 and 2018 . In 2018 , U.S. energy consumption derived from coal came to approximately 636.5 million short tons of this fossil fuel . Coal-fueled electricity generation in the United States The consumption of coal has risen steadily from the 1950s to the present . Recently , coal-fired electricity consumption has decreased in the United States from one billion short tons in 2007 to 636.5 million short tons in 2018 . Coal energy is primarily used for the electric power sector . In 2017 , the industrial sector accounted for 1.2 quadrillion British thermal units ( Btu ) while the electric power sector accounted for 12.7 quadrillion Btu . An Edison plant was built for New York City in 1882 and was the first coal-fired electricity plant in the United States . By the 1950s , coal was considered the leading source of fuel for electricity generation . Declines in coal usage occurred around 2007 , amidst the increased availability of renewables and natural gas . Environmental concerns surrounding coal and its emissions have also driven its gradual decline . The use of coal plants has been linked to acid rain , various emissions , and mercury pollution . The United States was the second largest consumer of coal in the world , totaling 453.4 million metric tons of oil equivalents ( mtoe ) . However , China 's consumption exceeds the total of many other countries combined , reaching 1,962.4 mtoe in 2014 . Coal is the second most common source of primary energy in the world . Electricity generation from fossil fuels is still a primary source of fuel around the world . Fossil fuel consumption in the United States reached some 80.2 quadrillion Btu in 2014 .
