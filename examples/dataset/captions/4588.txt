Uber Technologies went public on May 9 , 2019 . This was the largest initial public offering ( IPO ) in the United States in 2019 , raising 8.1 billion U.S. dollars . As shown in this statistic , the ten largest IPOs that year each raised over a billion dollars in capital . Why do companies go public ? Private companies have limited access to capital and mainly use traditional sources to finance their expenditures . While such firms have more freedom to operate without reporting to investors , this also blocks the companies from raising access directly from the public . The value raised by IPOs can be significant . In hopes of gaining access to this capital , the number of IPOs in the United States generally exceeds 100 firms each year . Risks of an IPO IPO is a long and costly process . It necessitates cooperation with investment advisory firms to ensure that all requirements are met and that the process is optimally planned . A public company is subject to governmental and public scrutiny â€“ any negative information , such as rumors about insider trading , can result in falling stock prices . Also , the time when going public is crucial . Even a prospering company can have a very low return in times of recession .
