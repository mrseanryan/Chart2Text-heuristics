France 's AREVA was one of the largest builders of nuclear reactors in the world . The company specialized in nuclear power and renewable energy . However , after its insolvency , AREVA sold most of its reactors to the French utility , EDF , while nuclear propulsion and research reactors were sold to Agence des participations de l'Ã‰tat . Its nuclear cycle business was also separated to a new company now called Orano . How do nuclear reactors work ? Nuclear reactors use the energy generated from splitting atoms . Uranium is the basic fuel used in nuclear reactors . This fission of uranium atoms produces energy that is harnessed as heat in the form of water or a gas and is then used to produce steam . The steam is then used to drive a turbine to produce electricity . What about nuclear waste ? After nuclear fuel has spent about three years in a nuclear reactor generating electricity , the fuel becomes nuclear waste . This high-level waste accounts for a small volume of waste but still contains the largest share of the radioactivity levels . Nuclear fuel waste is usually removed underwater and transferred to a storage pool as water can act as both a coolant and a shield . After about five years , this waste can be transferred into dry concrete containers or remain for up to 50 years in the storage pool . In comparison , about 90 percent of nuclear waste is only lightly-contaminated and considered low-level waste . This includes items like tools and work clothing from plant operation .
