In early 2018 the Labour Party was estimated to have over half a million members , by far the most of any political party in the United Kingdom . The next three largest parties in terms of members were the Conservatives , the Scottish National Party and the Liberal Democrats which all had membership numbers that numbered over 100 thousand . More members but less voters While the Labour Party clearly had more party members than the Conservative Party , it has also not been in power since 2010 and has struggled to oust successive Tory governments . In the 2017 General Election , despite achieving around 40 percent of the vote the Labour Party were still beaten by the Conservatives who had 42.2 percent of the vote and won an additional 56 seats . Could Labour win power in 2019 ? In the event of a general election in 2019 it is unclear who would come out on top . Current polls suggest that both the Labour and Conservative 's have lost significant levels of support , with 24 percent of adults advising they would vote for the Conservative Party , compared with only 18 percent of people who said they would vote for the Labour Party as of July 2019 .
