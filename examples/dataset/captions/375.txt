Tesla 's revenue grew to almost 24.6 billion U.S. dollars in the fiscal year of 2019 , a three billion increase from the previous year . The United States is Tesla 's largest sales markets . Revenue rises on model additions Almost 20 billion U.S. dollars of Tesla 's revenue is generated from its automotive segment , which includes the design , manufacturing , and sales of vehicles . As of 2019 , the electric vehicle ( EV ) maker has a model range that includes the Tesla Model S , Tesla Model X , and the newly released Tesla Model 3 . In addition to this , the company has announced that the highly anticipated Model Y will become available in 2020 . Model 3 legacy The Model 3 has emerged as Tesla 's best-selling vehicle , but the EV maker has also struggled with consistent net losses in recent years , spending an increasing amount both on selling , general , and administrative ( SG & A ) activities as well as research and development ( R & D ) activities . Much of Tesla 's spending has specifically been on production of its new Model 3 , a strongly popular vehicle with high demand . One response to this surge in popularity for the Model 3 was Tesla 's 2018 purchase of land for the construction of a Gigafactory in Shanghai , China . A factory within China will provide Tesla steady access to the Chinese electric vehicle market , a consistency welcomed in the midst of tensions between the U.S. and China over trade policies .
