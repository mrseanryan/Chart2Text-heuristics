The year 2006 saw the peak in issuance of residential mortgage backed securities , at 1.28 trillion U.S. dollars . This was also at the peak of the housing bubble which was one of the triggers of the 2008 Financial Crisis . Since then mortgaged backed securities are less popular , dropping to 63.7 billion U.S. dollars in 2019 . What are mortgage backed securities ? A mortgage backed security is a financial instrument in which a group of mortgages are bundled together and sold to the investors . The idea is that the risk of these individual mortgages is pooled when they are packaged together . This is a sound investment policy , unless the foreclosure rate increases significantly in a short amount of time . Mortgage risk Since mortgages are loans backed by an asset , the house , the risk is often considered relatively low . However , the loan maturities are very long , sometimes decades , meaning lenders must factor in the risk of a shift in the economic climate . As such , interest rates on longer mortgages tend to be higher than on shorter loans . The ten year treasury yield influences these rates , since it is a long-term rate that most investors accept as risk-free . Additionally , a drop in the value of homeowner equity could lead to a situation where the debtor is `` underwater '' and owes more than the home is worth .
