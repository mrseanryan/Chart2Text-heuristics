One of the leading economic industries in Australia , coal mining has contributed significantly to the local economy . In 2030 , Australian coal was projected to cost around 60 real U.S. dollars per metric ton . Coal market The contribution of the coal mining industry to Australia 's economy was valued at over 39 billion Australian dollars in 2018 . Coal consumption is much lower than production in Australia , so most of the mined coal is exported . In fact , Australia exports the most coal by value out of any other country , with major export partners including China and Japan . Australia 's reliance on its mining exports may lead to potential problems , particularly if long-term demand drops due to emerging alternative fuel sources , climate action and increased competition from other coal producing countries . The effect on the tens of thousands of Australian workers in the mining industry may have already been seen , with lower employment numbers recorded recently . Environmental impact Of late , the fugitive emissions from coal mining have come under fire due to their contribution to environmental pollution . In Australia , emissions from underground coal mines were estimated to total 25 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2030 â€“ the greatest contributor to greenhouse gases compared to other oil and gas subsectors . With a global focus on reducing air pollution and mitigating climate effects , the future of mining in Australia may not be as certain as it once was .
