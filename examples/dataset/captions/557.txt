The birth of the Super Bowl The AFL was a professional league that competed alongside the NFL for ten seasons between 1960 and 1969 . The new league grew a dedicated following of fans , and as competition on the field intensified , the two rival leagues agreed to introduce an AFL-NFL championship game at the end of the 1966 season – this game would later be named the Super Bowl in 1968 . Teams from the NFL won the first two editions of the fixture ; however , teams from the AFL won the following two , highlighting the quality of the league and ultimately helping to unite the rival leagues ahead of the 1970 season .
