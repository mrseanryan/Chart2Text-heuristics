The statistic reflects the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in member states of the European Union in August 2019 . The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in Spain in August 2019 was 13.8 percent.The unemployment rate represents the share of the unemployed in all potential employees available to the job market . Unemployment rates in the EU The unemployment rate is an important measure of a country or region 's economic health , and despite unemployment levels in the European Union falling slightly from a peak in early 2013 , they remain high , especially in comparison to what the rates were before the worldwide recession started in 2008 . This confirms the continuing stagnation in European markets , which hits young job seekers particularly hard as they struggle to compete against older , more experienced workers for a job , suffering under jobless rates twice as high as general unemployment . Some companies , such as Microsoft and Fujitsu , have created thousands of jobs in some of the countries which have particularly dire unemployment rates , creating a beacon of hope . However , some industries such as information technology , face the conundrum of a deficit of qualified workers in the local unemployed work force , and have to hire workers from abroad instead of helping decrease the local unemployment rates . This skills mismatch has no quick solution , as workers require time for retraining to fill the openings in the growing science- , technology- , or engineering-based jobs , and too few students choose degrees that would help them obtain these positions . Worldwide unemployment also remains high , with the rates being worst in the Middle East and North Africa . Estimates by the International Labour Organization predict that the problem will stabilize in coming years , but not improve until at least 2017 .
