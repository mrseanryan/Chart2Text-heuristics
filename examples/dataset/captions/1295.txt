In December 2019 , singer-songwriter Angèle had the most followers of all Belgian influencers on Instagram . This according to data provided by InfluencerDB . The musician had several hit songs in 2018 , including number one hit Tout Oublier in Belgium and France with her brother Romeo Elvis ( fourth in this ranking ) . Most influencers in this ranking are either active in music ( such as rapper Roméo Elvis and DJ Amelie Lens ) or in fashion , like Matthias Geerts and Chloé Kitembo . Gaëlle Garcia Diaz ( sixth in the ranking ) and fellow-vlogger and actor Jimmy Labeeu ( in second ) were married to each other for several years . Instagram users in Belgium were typically women , aged 18 to 24 years old , which could be a potential explanation for these interests . Instagram is popular in Belgium but not as popular as in the rest of Europe… Instagram had three million active users in Belgium . When compared to the rest of Europe , though , Belgium did not rank among the leading countries when it comes to the use of the photo app . The share of the Belgian population that used Instagram was lower than , for example , that of Italy , Spain , the United Kingdom and its neighbors Luxembourg and the Netherlands . … but Belgian teenagers increasingly use it In a 2018 survey among teenagers from Flanders ( the northern , Dutch-speaking part of Belgium ) , Instagram was said to be the third most used app Facebook and Snapchat . Compared to the same survey held in 2016 , however , the application saw the biggest increase of all social media platforms .
