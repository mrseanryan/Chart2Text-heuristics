In 2018 , the number of passenger cars sold in Germany amounted to 3.4 million units . This was a slight decrease compared to the previous year . The German automobile industry has been growing consecutively in the past few years and is one of the biggest in the world . `` Abwrackprämie '' boosts sales in 2009 The number of cars sold on the German market peaked at 3.8 million units in 2009 . This was due to the government 's introduction of a scrappage program , the so-called `` Abwrackprämie '' . It had been implemented for the purpose of bettering air quality by encouraging owners to scrap their old car ( over the age of 9 ) and buying a newer , supposedly more environmentally friendly Euro 4 model . Controversy surrounded the program at the time , because car sales had been declining in the years prior and it was seen by many as a move intended to help German carmakers make greater profits . Evaluations by Environmental Action Germany ( `` Deutsche Umwelthilfe '' ) and the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research Heidelberg ( `` ifeu '' ) concluded that the ecological benefit was minimal if not non-existent . According to the Federal Office of Economics and Export Control , Volkswagen was the car brand profiting the most from the program . German new car market generates 107bn euros The German new car market brought in 107 billion euros in revenues in 2018 , having grown consecutively since 2013 . By comparison , sales of used cars had generated 84.7 billion euros .
