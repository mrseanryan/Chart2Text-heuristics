The degree of urbanization in the United Kingdom amounted to 83.4 percent in 2018 . This shows almost a three percentage point increase over the past decade . The upward trend , though slow , has been consistently positive . What is urbanization ? The rate of urbanization indicates the shift away from rural living as people come together in densely populated cities . The United Kingdom is much more urban than the worldwide average . This puts people in closer proximity to jobs , health care , stores , and social opportunities , leading to better economic , health , and social outcomes . For example , areas with higher urbanization have a higher average life expectancy at birth . The darker side of urbanization London is the United Kingdom 's largest city and arguably the financial capital of Europe . However , this economic success has led to increasingly high rental prices , which is an indication of the high cost of living in the city . The higher population density can also lead in an increase in crime . London has one of the highest homicide rates in England and Wales . In spite of these drawbacks , London continues to draw millions of overseas tourists every year .
