The statistic shows the top-25 players at the FIFA World Cup 2014 in Brazil according to their current market / transfer value . Lionel Messi of Argentina is the highest valued player with a transfer market value of 120 million euros . Market values of players at the World Cup 2014 - additional information The market/transfer value of a football player is determined by a number of statistics , including the player 's age , salary , playing stats and recent performances . As such it is subject to change frequently depending on the player 's current situation . As of the World Cup held in Brazil 2014 , Argentina 's Lionel Messi was the most expensive player among the 32 national squads and he is commonly rated as one of football 's all-time best players . He is the first player in history to win four FIFA/Ballons d'Or ( 2009 , 2010 , 2011 , 2012 ) and the first to win three European Golden Shoe awards ( 2010 , 2012 , 2013 ) . Second on the list is Portugal 's Cristiano Ronaldo whose market value was estimated at 100 million euros as of the start of the World Cup . In 2009 Ronaldo 's transfer from Manchester United to Real Madrid for 94 million euros broke the world transfer record which Madrid previously held for their purchase of Kak√° from Milan . Real Madrid have since broken their own transfer record again having bought Gareth Bale from Tottenham Hotspur for 100 million euros in 2013 . However , as Wales failed to qualify for the World Cup in 2014 , Bale does not feature on this list . Paul Pogba , aged 21 at the time of the 2014 World Cup , is the youngest player on the list . At the 2014 FIFA World Cup awards he was named Best Young Player after several impressive performances for France . Germany leads the way with 6 national players on the list with their high market value seemingly validated by the fact that Germany went on to win the 2014 World Cup .
