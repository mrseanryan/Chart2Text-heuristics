Iran 's gross domestic product ( GDP ) declined by 4.85 percent in 2018 after adjusting for inflation . This figure fell from 12.5 percent growth two years ago , which had been a reaction to sanctions lifting after the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action ( JPCOA ) regarding Iran 's nuclear program . United States president Donald Trump ended that country 's participation in the deal , imposing new sanctions . Political influence on the economy Political tensions have hampered the economy of Iran , keeping growth low in spite of the country 's considerable oil reserves . The effect of these sanctions becomes obvious when looking at Iran 's oil exports to Europe over the past decade . Some analysts have blamed the new sanctions for the increase in Iran 's inflation rate , as well as the currency depreciation that has accompanied it . Iran 's options Although Iran 's main export partners are largely in Asia , many of the transactions are carried out using U.S. dollars . Even though other means of payment are possible , some countries worry about political ramifications of continuing trade relations with Iran . Iran 's greatest strength at the moment may be its low national debt , meaning that it can borrow a substantial amount of money if it can find a willing lender . However , given the instability of the political situation worldwide and regionally , it is difficult to assume that such a borrower exists at the moment .
