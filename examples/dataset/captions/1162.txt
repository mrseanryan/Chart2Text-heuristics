Urbanization in the United States With the United States being populated and inhabited by settlers and migrants quite late in comparison to other nations , urbanization took place a lot later than in other developed nations . Urbanization is defined as the migration of people to the cities ( mostly from rural areas , but also from other countries ) making the cities larger and more populated . The term â€˜ Urbanization ' is mainly used in reference to larger cities , it is a phenomenon caused by the migration of people to urban areas in search of better living standards , for example greater job opportunities , better health conditions or housing . Urbanization is one of the factors that has contributed to the abandonment of rural areas and the agricultural way of life in favor of industrial jobs and improved conditions . Many young people from rural areas see moving to the city as a way of enabling them to live their life in the manner that they choose . Urbanization in the States was most prominent on the East Coast to begin with , as it initially served as the main point of entry for the majority of migrants ; the gradual settling of other areas of the country followed subsequently . Today , however , Western parts of the United States are classed as being the most urbanized ; the majority of cities and urban areas can be found here . The Northeast is also highly urbanized , with New York being the most populous city in the United States . According to the US Census Bureau , out of all US states , only four still have a rural majority : Vermont , West Virginia , Mississippi and Maine .
