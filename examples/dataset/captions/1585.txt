This statistic shows the degree of urbanization in Germany from 2008 to 2018 . Urbanization means the share of urban population in the total population of a country . In 2018 , 77.31 percent of Germany 's total population lived in urban areas and cities . Urbanization in Germany Currently , about three quarter of the German population live in urban areas and cities , which is more than in most nations around the world . Urbanization , as it can be seen in this graph , refers to the number of people living in an urban area and has nothing to do with the actual geographical size or footprint of an area or country . A country which is significantly bigger than Germany could have a similar degree of urbanization , just because not all areas in the country are inhabitable , for example . One example for this is Russia , where urbanization has reached comparable figures to Germany , even though its geographical size is significantly bigger . However , Germany 's level of urbanization does not make the list of the top 30 most urbanized nations in the world , where urbanization rates are higher than 83 percent . Also , while 25 percent of the population in Germany still lives in rural areas , rural livelihoods are not dependent on agriculture , as only 0.75 percent of GDP came from the agricultural sector in 2014 . So while Germany 's urbanization rate is growing , a significant percentage of the population is still living in rural areas . Furthermore , Germany has a number of shrinking cities which are located to the east and in older industrial regions around the country . Considering that population growth in Germany is on the decline , because of low fertility rates , and that a number of cities are shrinking , the urban population is likely shifting to bigger cities which have more economic opportunities than smaller ones .
