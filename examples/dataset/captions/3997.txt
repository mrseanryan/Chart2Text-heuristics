The fertility rate in Sweden reached the lowest point in a ten-year period in 2019 , when it was down to 1.7 children per woman . The fertility rate is defined as the number of children that would be born or are likely to be born to a woman if she lives to the end of her reproductive years . A similar decline was visible for the crude birth rate , which in 2019 was down at the lowest point since many years . More immigrants than emigrants Despite that the fertility rate and the crude birth rate in Sweden are at their lowest points , and have been declining for years , the population in Sweden continues to grow . More babies are born each year than people dying , which is a factor to a still growing population . The major reason behind a continued population growth though is the positive inflow of immigrants . Few Swedish citizens are leaving the country , while many more migrants are arriving to Sweden . The number of babies born is increasing Since the population is growing , the number of women in reproductive age are too , which may be a contributing a factor to more childbirths . The number of babies born over time is quite stable in Sweden , and around 115 thousand babies were born in 2019 .
