Monaco is the country with the highest median age in the world . The population has a median age of around 53 years , which is around six years more than in Japan and Germany â€“ the other countries that make up the top three . Southern European countries make up a large part of the top 20 , with Italy , Slovenia , Greece , San Marino , Andorra , and Croatia all making the list . Low infant mortality means higher life expectancy Monaco and Japan also have the lowest infant mortality rates in the world , which contributes to the calculation of a higher life expectancy because fewer people are dying in the first years of life . Indeed , many of the nations with a high median age also feature on the list of countries with the highest average life expectancy , such as San Marino , Japan , Italy , and Lichtenstein . Demographics of islands and small countries Many smaller countries and island nations have populations with a high median age , such as Guernsey and the Isle of Man , which are both island territories within the British Isles . An explanation for this could be that younger people leave to seek work or education opportunities , while others choose to relocate there for retirement .
