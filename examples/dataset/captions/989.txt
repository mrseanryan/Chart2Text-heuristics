Volkswagen 's operating profit rose 0.7 percent in 2018 over the previous year and now stands at a record 13.92 billion euros . Since the costly diesel scandal , Volkswagen 's reputation seems to have recovered and many performance indicators are now above pre-scandal figures . This is impressive considering that in both 2017 and 2018 , the company had significant one-off costs related to the diesel scandal . The automotive industry in the United States may be struggling to sell new sedans , including about 80 percent of Volkswagen models , but VW has much larger markets in Europe and the Asia Pacific . Both regions are increasing in deliveries and revenue . Consequently , VW 's operating profit is expected to increase between 6.5 and 7.5 percent year-on-year . These expectations are a sign of great confidence despite volatile global exchange rates and upcoming changes in European engine emissions regulation . Scandal and recovery The German car manufacturing group had suffered a major hit in 2015 , after it came to light that many of its diesel engine vehicles did not meet U.S. clean air targets , and engines and test results had been tampered with . In attempt to rectify the issue , the company announced they would spend 16.2 billion euros recalling and buying back vehicles , as well as implementing new equipment . As a result of their fraudulent activity , Volkswagen were given a 2.8 billion U.S. dollar fine from the United States with more private and governmental action lawsuits to be launched across the globe . In light of the scandal , the reputation of VW dropped substantially , and the company is expected to lose out on 200 billion U.S. dollars in sales over a ten-year period to 2025 . That said , the company is back on its feet for now . In fact , the VW Golf was the highest selling car in Europe between July and December of 2018 - and the third highest selling was the VW Polo .
