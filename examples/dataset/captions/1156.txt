After reaching a record high in 2016 , China 's labor force shrank to around 805.67 million people in 2018 . A country 's labor force is defined as the total number of employable people and incorporates both the employed and the unemployed population . The share of the population participating in the labor market in China also decreased over the past years , reaching about 68 percent in 2018 . Population challenges for China One of the reasons for the shrinking labor force is the Chinese one-child policy , which had been in effect for nearly 40 years , until it was revoked in 2016 . The controversial policy was intended to improve people 's living standards and optimize resource distribution through controlling the size of China 's expanding population . Nonetheless , the policy also led to negative impacts on the labor market , pension system and other societal aspects . Today , China is becoming an aging society . The increase of elderly people and the lack of young people will become one of the biggest challenges for China in this century . Employment in China Despite the slowing down of economic growth , China 's unemployment rate has sustained a relatively low rate . Complete production chains and a well-educated labor force make China 's labor market one of the most attractive in the world . Working conditions and salaries in China have also improved significantly over the past years . Due to China 's leading position in terms of talent in the technology industry , the country is now attracting investment from some of the world 's leading companies in the high-tech sector .
