In 2018 , a total of 1.3 billion tickets were sold in the United States and Canada . Whilst this is an improvement on the 1.23 billion sold in 2017 , sales have not exceeded 1.4 billion since 2009 . What can affect ticket sales ? The factors influencing movie ticket sales are many , with the appeal of current movies ( or lack thereof ) being the most obvious reason why a film fan may purchase more or fewer tickets over the course of a year . However , surveys have revealed that the general public , at least in the United States , are not necessarily happy with how expensive visits to the cinema have become . In 2018 , a study showed that the majority of U.S. respondents cited the cost of movie tickets as the main reason for seeing fewer movies in theaters . These concerns are not unfounded â€“ the average price of a movie theater ticket in North America was 9.11 U.S. dollars in 2018 , an increase of 14 cents from the previous year . Whilst this may not sound like much , ticket prices have been climbing for years , and with the average number of people per family in the U.S. standing at 3.14 , a family trip to the movies could cost almost 30 dollars . This is before purchasing concessions , which rarely provide the best value for money . The price of concessions in movie theaters was also a reason why U.S. adults said they made fewer trips to the cinema than they used to . Costs : streaming services vs. movie theater tickets The experience of going to the cinema versus an evening spent indoors watching Netflix content are two very different things . However , the content available to watch in each scenario is also very different , and therein lies the appeal of streaming services . Not only do such services offer their subscribers the chance to enjoy content at their leisure in their own home , the monthly costs of certain video services are close to matching the price of a cinema ticket . Monthly fees for certain streaming subscriptions can be as little as nine to 15 dollars per month , for the benefit of being able to access the content you want , when you want . When compared to paying over nine dollars for a movie theater ticket , streaming is certainly the better value option .
