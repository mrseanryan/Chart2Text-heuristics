In 2018 , the average inflation rate in Nepal was at 4.15 percent , a slight drop compared to the previous year . The inflation rate is calculated using the price increase of a defined product basket . This product basket contains products and services on which the average consumer spends money throughout the year . They include expenses for groceries , clothes , rent , power , telecommunications , recreational activities , and raw materials ( e.g . gas , oil ) , as well as federal fees and taxes . Political and economic turmoil The Nepalese economy is heavily influenced by the country 's political situation . It has made only slow progress in connecting with the global economy and improving the standard of living for its inhabitants but is now finally picking up speed . Nepal 's economy is not stable yet : Inflation is decreasing but all over the place – usually a sure sign of a struggling economy – and GDP growth is also not steady and forecast to decrease again in the future . Additionally , Nepal 's trade deficit seems to be in free fall . Move to the city A quarter of Nepal 's , mostly rural , population is living below the poverty line , but Nepal is working on improving their outlook in the future . Today , agriculture contributes about a third to the country 's GDP , and a sizeable share of commodity exports consists of agricultural products – but already the lion 's share of Nepal 's GDP is generated by the services sector , like tourism and textiles . By shifting GDP generation to services , and consequently creating jobs in the cities and attracting more people to urban areas , Nepal might finally be able to stabilize its economy and provide better living standards for its inhabitants .
