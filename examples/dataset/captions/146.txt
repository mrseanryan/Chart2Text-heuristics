Manchester United was the highest paying club in the EPL for the previous two seasons , while Sheffield United , which moved up into the EPL from the Football League Championship this season , paid the lowest annual average of approximately 910 thousand U.S. dollars per player in 2019/20 . Payments in similar European leagues Manchester City may be the most generous employer in the EPL at this point but they do n't hold this title at the European level . Juventus , in Italy 's Serie-A for example , pay their players an average of 10.1 million U.S. dollars . This slightly higher amount comes in spite of the facts that the EPL generates revenue of more than twice as much as the Serie A overall .

When asked `` Which club is your favourite Premier League club ? `` , 22.6 percent of English stated Manchester United , followed by 16.4 percent naming Liverpool Football Club .
