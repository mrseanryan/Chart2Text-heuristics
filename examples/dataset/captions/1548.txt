The median age of the population in Japan has steadily been increasing since 1950 and is projected to be around 48 years old in 2020 . As of 2017 , the median age of Japan is the second highest in the world , behind the Principality of Monaco . The elderly in Japan An improved quality of life and regular health checks are just two reasons why Japan has one of the highest life expectancies in the world . The life expectancy from birth in Japan improved significantly after World War II , rising 20 years in the decade between 1945 and 1955 . As life expectancy continues to increase , Japan expects difficulties caring for the older generation in the future . Shortages in the service sector are already a major concern , with demand for nurses and care workers increasing . Fertility and birth rates The fertility rate among Japan 's population has been around 1.4 children per woman since 2010 . Apart from a small baby boom in the early seventies , the crude birth rate of Japan has been declining since 1950 and is expected to be as low as 7.5 births per thousand people in 2020 . With falling birth rates and such a large share of its inhabitants reaching their later years , Japan 's total population is expected to continue declining .
