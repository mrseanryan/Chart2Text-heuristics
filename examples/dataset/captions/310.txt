This statistics presents the unemployment rate in Australia from 2014 to 2018 , with projections up until 2024 . Unemployment occurs when people are without work , it is also known as joblessness . In order that the prevalence of unemployment can be measured , a calculation is made by the division of the number of unemployed individuals by all individuals currently in the labor force , this yields a percentage rate . In 2018 , about 5.29 percent of the Australian population had been unemployed.Unemployment in Australia The rising rate of Australian unemployment and the employment slowdown poses a challenge for the new Australian administration . The prevalence of youth unemployment will be a particular challenge , as the rate of full-time jobseekers in the 15 to 19 year-old age group rose to 25.5 percent in early July . The adult unemployment rate in 2013 was at just over 5.6 percent . The problem of youth unemployment is a direct result of the marked reduction in the number of entry-level jobs in the labor market in the past few decades . With an ageing workforce and an even more rapidly aging population , the problem is set to become even more serious . There is little doubt that a high rate of unemployment among the youth will have an adverse affect on the future productivity and retirement of the workforce of today . The unemployment rate in Australia is a serious problem . Long term unemployment - and the unemployed youth especially - will result in the loss of productivity in Australia and put greater pressure on the health , welfare systems and other public services in the future . Unemployment inevitably leads to poor living standards and poverty , which is why it is something to be tackled .
