In 2018 , Nokia had 22.5 billion euros in net sales , which is a small decrease from the year before . In the past decade , the company has made several directional shifts from handheld devices to network infrastructure in order to keep up with the quickly evolving electronics and telecommunications industry . Focus on B2B markets and products After selling its mobile and devices segment to Microsoft in 2014 , Nokia has focused on its network infrastructure business . The company is now offering an end-to-end portfolio of software , services , equipment , and licensing products focused on B2B network customers . In recent years , Nokia has invested strongly into research and development developing 5G cellular network technology , and competes with Ericsson , Huawei , and others to implement this infrastructure . Smartphone pioneer to mobile infrastructure Over 150 years old , Nokia has experience adapting to changing market environments , entering new markets , and developing new products . Since the early 2000s , Nokia was known primarily as a cell phone manufacturer . However , facing strong competition from Apple and Samsung , Nokia 's sales dropped in the late 2000s . One reason for the decline in Nokia 's share of the mobile phone market was holding on too long onto its own mobile operating system ( OS ) Symbian and not switching over to the at the time up and coming OS Android by Google . In 2014 , Nokia sold its devices & services business to Microsoft for 5.44 billion euros . Since then , Nokia only sells branding licenses for smartphones , in a small but lucrative business segment .
