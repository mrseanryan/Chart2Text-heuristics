In 2018 , the rate of forcible rapes in the United States stood at 30.9 per 100,000 inhabitants . While this figure is about the same as it was in 2007 , when the rate was 30.6 , it has decreased from 1990 , when there were 41.2 forcible rapes per 100,000 inhabitants . What is forcible rape ? According to the FBI , forcible rape is defined as `` sexual penetration , no matter how slight , with a body part or object without the consent of the victim . '' This definition changed in 2013 from the previous definition , which specified `` carnal knowledge of a female victim forcibly and against her will . '' Attempted rape was included in the previous definition , but statutory rape and other sexual offenses were excluded . The old definition was seen as problematic , as people of any gender can be raped . Since the revision of the definition of rape , reported rapes increased by about 20 percent , although it is not clear if this is due to the revised definition or if the rate itself has increased . Rape in the United States While rape and sexual assault have been extensively talked about in the U.S. in recent years , especially since the start of the # metoo movement , there is still a large number of sexual offences committed each year . Sadly , the majority of sex offences in the U.S. are carried out against individuals age 20 and under . Astoundingly , the Anchorage , Alaska metropolitan area had the highest rape rate in the United States in 2018 , followed by Rapid City , South Dakota . Since rape and sexual assault continue to be underreported in the United States , it is important to find a solution to this devastating problem .
