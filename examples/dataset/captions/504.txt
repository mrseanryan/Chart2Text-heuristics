The gender or sex ratio in China has been a contentious issue since the introduction of the one-child policy in 1979 , intended to limit the population of the country . Although the policy is no longer in place , the population gender difference throughout the country is still evident . In 2018 , ten to fourteen-year old children had the largest gender disparity of 118.62 males to every 100 females . Gender imbalance While the difference of gender at birth has been decreasing in the country over the past decade , China still boasts the world 's most skewed sex ratio at birth at around 114 males born for every 100 females as of 2018 . That means there are about 30 million more men in the country than women . This imbalance likely came from the country 's traditional preference for male children to continue the family lineage , in combination with the population control policies enforced . Where does that leave the population ? The surplus of young , single men across the country poses a risk for China in many different socio-economic areas . Some of the roll-on effects include males overrepresenting specific labor markets , savings rates increasing , consumption reducing and violent crime increasing across the country . However , the adult mortality rate in China , that is , the probability of a 15-year-old dying before reaching age 60 , was significantly higher for men than for women . For the Chinese population over 60 years of age , the gender ratio is in favor of women , with more females outliving their male counterparts .
