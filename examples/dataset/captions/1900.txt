Following a period of consistent growth , the locomotive fleet of U.S. class I railroad operators fell slightly to 26,546 locomotives in 2017 , from 26,719 locomotives in the previous year , only to increase again to 26,086 in 2018 . Class I railroads Class I railroads are the largest freight railroad operators in the U.S. Officially they are defined as having annual carrier operating revenues of 250 million U.S. dollars or more in 1991 dollars . Currently there are seven class I operators : Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway , CSX Transportation , Grand Trunk Corporation , Kansas City Southern Railway , Norfolk Southern Combined Railroad Subsidiaries , Soo Line Corporation , and Union Pacific Railroad . Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific Railway are also considered as class I operators due to their significant U.S. presence . In total , around 118,799 miles of railroad is operated in the U.S. by class I operators . The largest two class I operators in terms of revenue are BNSF and Union Pacific . Freight in the U.S. Over the last two decades , roughly 2.5 trillion ton-kilometers of rail freight were transported annually in the United States . Although a large number , this figure is a fraction of the 5.6 trillion ton-miles of total freight transported on average each year . Accordingly , even the largest class I rail operators generate significantly less revenue than the two main companies which provide road and air freight services , UPS and FedEx .
