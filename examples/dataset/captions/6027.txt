Household waste volumes per person in England remained at a similar level between 2010 and 2017 . Although there was an overall decrease during this period , the household volumes were still over 400 kilograms per person in 2017 . The region which generated the largest volume of residual waste per household was the North East of England , where an average of 601 kilograms of waste was generated per person in 2017/2018 . Recycling rates slowing down From 2000/2001 to 2011/2012 , the recycling rates of household waste in England increased steadily from just 11.2 percent to 43 percent . However , since then there has been no noticeable increase in recycling rates . In fact , in 2015/2016 , recycling rates dropped slightly to levels last seen in 2011/2012 . In 2019 , the UK Government set out plans to overhaul the waste system . One proposal to improve household recycling levels was to introduce more consistent sets of recyclable materials , such as separate food waste collection . Food waste Food waste is a growing concern worldwide , with an estimated 1.6 billion metric tons going to waste each year . This is approximately one third of the total food produced globally . In 2017 , 75 kilograms of food per capita was wasted in the UK . In comparison , Italy , which has a similar population size to the UK generated 145 kilograms of food waste per capita .
