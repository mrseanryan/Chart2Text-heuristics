No game of baseball is complete without a trip to the concessions stand , but how much money a fan needs to part with in order to get their hands on a hot dog varies widely from team to team . While a hot dog at the home games of the Baltimore Orioles would set you back just 1.5 U.S. dollars , the same snack at Citi Field during a New York Mets game would cost you 6.75 U.S. dollars . Digging deep for snacks It seems that baseball in the Big Apple does not come cheap . As well as the 6.75 U.S. dollars for a hot dog , the smallest beer offered at the New York Mets costs an eye-watering 11 U.S. dollars . The picture is slightly better on the other side of Rikers Island at the New York Yankees . In the Yankee Stadium , a small beer costs six U.S. dollars , a figure that is roughly average for the league . Soft drinks , meanwhile , are priced at a reasonable three U.S. dollars at the Yankees and 5.75 U.S. dollars at the Mets , although the size of the portions does vary from stadium to stadium . Overall , treating yourself to some snacks during the ball game has become increasingly expensive . Prices for beer , soft drinks , and hot dogs have all seen a significant increase between 2010 and 2019 . Following your team does not come cheap Nothing beats watching your favorite baseball team play live in the stadium , but this enjoyment comes at a cost . The whole experience , including food and merchandise , for a family of four cost a league-wide average of 234.38 U.S. dollars in the 2019 season . The most expensive day out was at the Chicago Cubs , where a family would have to fork out over 370 U.S. dollars . Fans of the Arizona Diamondbacks , meanwhile , would only have to pay just over 142 U.S. dollars to experience their team live .
