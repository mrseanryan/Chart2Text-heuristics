In 2008 , approximately 26.5 million households in France disposed of one television or more . In 2017 , the number of French households owning at least one television amounted to 28.6 million .

Streaming and Internet TV The advent of Smart TVs seems to have increased people 's fondness for television . The possibility of accessing online content through a television brought about a new internet-based broadcasting system . Companies such as the American Netflix profited immensely from this new technology . In France alone , Netflix recorded a 31 percent coverage among youths aged 15 to 24 years in June 2018 . Moreover , among the total French audience , Netflix 's coverage increased from 7,7 percent in October 2017 to 14,3 percent in May 2018 . Nevertheless , the United Kingdom remains the leading Netflix market in Europe based on subscription numbers : almost 7 million people in the country subscribed to Netflix as of December 2017 .

Even though Germany is only slightly ahead of France in matters of internet TV penetration , the number cinema goers in Germany has decreased from a total of 135.9 million visitors in 2015 to only 100.1 million in 2018 . Germany also happens to be the second leading market for Netflix in Europe . On the other hand , in France , there was an increasing number of cinema admissions recorded between 2013 and 2016 .
