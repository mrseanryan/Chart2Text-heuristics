The statistic shows the average inflation rate in Canada from 1984 to 2018 , with projections up until 2024 . The inflation rate is calculated using the price increase of a defined product basket . This product basket contains products and services , on which the average consumer spends money throughout the year . They include expenses for groceries , clothes , rent , power , telecommunications , recreational activities and raw materials ( e.g . gas , oil ) , as well as federal fees and taxes . In 2018 , the average inflation rate in Canada was approximately 2.24 percent compared to the previous year . For comparison , inflation in India amounted to 5.22 percent that same year . Inflation in Canada In general , the inflation rate in Canada follows a global trend of decreasing inflation rates since 2011 , with the lowest slump expected to occur during 2015 , but forecasts show an increase over the following few years . Additionally , Canada 's inflation rate is in quite good shape compared to the rest of the world . While oil and gas prices have dropped in Canada much like they have around the world , food and housing prices in Canada have been increasing . This has helped to offset some of the impact of dropping oil and gas prices and the effect this has had on CanadaÂ´s inflation rate . The annual consumer price index of food and non-alcoholic beverages in Canada has been steadily increasing over the last decade . The same is true for housing and other price indexes for the country . In general there is some confidence that the inflation rate will not stay this low for long , it is expected to return to a comfortable 2 percent by 2017 if estimates are correct .
