This statistic shows the median age of the population in Brazil from 1950 to 2050 . The median age is the age that divides a population into two numerically equal groups ; that is , half the people are younger than this age and half are older . It is a single index that summarizes the age distribution of a population . In 2015 , the median age of the Brazilian population was 31.4 years . Brazil as a developing nation The average age of the Brazil 's population has risen from a low of 18.2 years in 1965 to 31.2 years in 2015 , a typical change in developing nations , and other demographic parameters support this trend : As of 2014 , the share of children under 14 years of age stood at around 23.5 percent , a great improvement from earlier times . Since 2005 , the fertility rate has also dropped significantly , but now it is even lower than the natural replacement rate at 1.78 children per woman . Over the same period of time , life expectancy has also risen to 74.4 years of age - higher than the average for developing nations . These changes typically happen as a result of developing countries becoming more modernized and economically diverse . Brazil 's economy had been getting significantly stronger and per capita GDP peaked in 2011 at a much higher value than the regional average for Latin America and the Caribbean . However , the Brazilian economy has reached a difficult point , and GDP per capita is expected to fall to as low as 7,447 U.S. dollars in 2016 . As Brazil 's demographics are now similar to other developing countries , the economy has not been able to maintain a similar path to steady growth .
