This statistic represents the global number of permanent nuclear reactor shutdowns between 2005 and August 2019 . Following the nuclear accident in Japan in March 2011 , four reactors at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant were shut down permanently . In total , there were seven permanent shutdowns in 2018 . Reaction to Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear DisasterGlobally , nuclear power plants have a capacity totaling over 396.9 gigawatts as of 2018 . In 2018 , there were seven permanent nuclear reactor shutdowns that occurred around the world . Many of these shutdowns were in response to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster which occurred when an earthquake and a tsunami struck the region on March 11 , 2011 , causing equipment failure and three nuclear meltdowns . This was the second event after the Chernobyl disaster that was classified as a Level 7 event by the International Nuclear Event Scale , which communicates important safety information of nuclear accidents . The disaster prompted much of the public to lose confidence in nuclear energy and question its safety . Afterwards , many countries accelerated their plans for nuclear power plant shutdowns . As of 2017 , Germany , for example , accounted for about 2.8 percent of the world 's nuclear energy consumption after power plant shutdowns had been initiated . In Italy , a national referendum was held and almost 95 percent of people voted against plans to build new nuclear power plants . In the United States , some 65 percent of people favor the use of nuclear energy . In other countries like Germany , 77 percent of critics were already decidedly against nuclear energy prior to the events in Japan . In Japan , there were 37operational nuclear reactors as of June 2019 .
