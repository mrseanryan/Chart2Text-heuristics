For the past few years , Sri Lanka 's economy has been thriving . Gross domestic product is soaring , and despite the densely populated country being among the smallest in the Asia Pacific region , its GDP per capita is not â€“ it has almost doubled over the past decade . Sri Lanka 's inflation rate has been through the wringer , however : From around seven percent in 2013 to a sudden slump to around two percent in 2015 with a rapid upturn and peak at 6.5 percent in 2017 again , it is expected to stabilize around the 4.9 percent-mark over the next few years . The slump in 2015 is mainly due to the country amassing national debt , which is soaring just as much as GDP . Sri Lanka has been spending so much money on developing its infrastructure , it needed help from the International Monetary Fund . Bailed out The International Monetary Fund does not just bail a country out frivolously , although Sri Lanka is by far not the only one requesting financial aid . Other countries have turned to the IMF for help in the past , the most famous example of asking for a bailout is Greece , which still struggles with the consequences of economic turmoil , austerity , and debt years later . Bailout money comes with terms and conditions , since it is a temporary solution to facilitate resolving an economic crisis . Often , one of these conditions is that countries take matters into their own hands and do everything they can to avoid further crises and to help get themselves out of debt . Maxing out the cards Sri Lanka has been living above its means , but prognoses look promising . Inflation is expected to level off around five percent , as is government expenditure at around 20 percent of GDP . Debt is still rising , of course , but trade seems in good shape , as well , with exports increasing , lowering the trade deficit . All in all , it looks like investing in infrastructure may pay off after all .
