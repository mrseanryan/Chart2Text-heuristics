Worldwide industrial robot shipments increased by one percent from about 382,000 in 2017 to around 384,000 in 2018 . Global spending on industrial robots is projected to exceed 24 billion U.S. dollars by 2025 . Leading markets Japan , China , the United States , South Korea , and Germany are counted among the five leading industrial robot markets worldwide . In emerging manufacturing markets , the growth trend is largely driven by rising wages that make the use of machines appear a viable alternative to human labor . Leading applications for industrial robots Industrial robots can be deployed for a wide range of tasks in a growing number of industries . Although the highly automated car manufacturing sector remains the largest area of application for electro-mechanical machines , industrial robots are continuously making their way into other areas such as the food and beverages industry . It has to be noted that the field of robotics is a part of another industry : the automation market . This industry is comprised of a variety of products and services , including relays , switches , sensors and drives , machine vision and control systems , as well as industry software development and services . Conglomerates like Siemens , Mitsubishi Electric or General Electric are the major vendors of industrial automation and industry software . The key players in the industrial robot market include ABB , KUKA , Fanuc , Kawasaki , and Yaskawa .
