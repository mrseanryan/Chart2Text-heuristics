In the week ending January 9 , 2020 , the most streamed track on Spotify in the U.S. was ‘ The Box ' by Roddy Ricch with 18.95 million streams by U.S. users . Other songs to perform well that week were ‘ Circles ' by Post Malone and ‘ Yummy ' by Justin Bieber with over eight million streams each . Artists and streaming : a double-edged sword Whilst the ranking of most streamed songs changes each week , artists to frequently make the top five include chart-toppers Post Malone and Drake . In 2018 , Drake 's album ‘ Scorpion ' was streamed over six billion times in the U.S. alone and Post Malone 's ‘ Beerbongs & Bentleys ' followed closely behind . Having their music on Spotify can be a lucrative opportunity for popular music artists , allowing them to earn royalties per every song streamed . This is an opportunity which was not available to musicians who made a name for themselves before music streaming became a possibility and is just one of the many ways in which the music industry has changed over the last few decades . On a less positive note , artists have to accumulate hundreds of thousands of streams before they make any real money from Spotify . The majority of digital music revenue in the U.S. derived from streaming , but royalties paid to artists by Spotify are usually well below the one cent mark per stream . Spotify has frequently rebuffed accusations that its royalty payments structure is unfair , claiming that a better understanding of their business model was needed in order to appreciate how the payments work . However , as is often the case with anything that sounds too good to be true , featuring on Spotify is not enough for most artists to make a living , regardless of the amount of exposure the platform gives them .
