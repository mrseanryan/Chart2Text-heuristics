This statistic shows the national debt of the United Kingdom from 2014 to 2018 , with projections up until 2024 . In 2018 , the national debt in the United Kingdom was about 2.36 trillion U.S. dollars . Reduction of the national debt and recovery of the economy in the UK The debt of the United Kingdom , which amounted to around 1,600 billion pounds in 2014 - more than it has ever been - is projected to keep rising . Since the economic recession of 2007 - 08 , economic growth in the United Kingdom has been slow , but it has been able to recover . In 2014 , the United Kingdom recorded a 2.8 percent growth rate . Many believe that if the economy is stable , the government will reduce spending and not accrue any more debt , and it can indeed be seen that while government spending continues to increase , the gap between spending and revenue is projected to get smaller . If the government were to earn more than it spends , it could use the money left over to pay the national debt and start to reduce it . However , what is even more important is the size of the debt in relation to the size of the country 's economy ; if the debt grows slower than the economy , the debt to GDP ratio can still fall , despite a budget deficit . The ratio of government expenditure to GDP indicates that the economy is recovering at a faster rate than government expenditure , with the ratio decreasing significantly over the last decade and the national debt in relation to GDP being expected to decrease further as well - albeit slowly . This should help relieve concerns over the United Kingdom 's mounting debt , but for some debt reduction is just not fast enough .
