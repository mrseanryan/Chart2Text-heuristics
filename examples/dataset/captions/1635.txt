The median age of the population of Singapore has been increasing since 1965 , and is projected to reach 42.2 years by 2020 . The median age is the age that divides a population into two numerically equal groups , such that half the people are younger than this age and half are older . An aging population As Singapore 's median age increases , its fertility rate has decreased . In 2017 , Singapore 's fertility rate was 1.16 children per woman of childbearing age , which is below the amount needed to replace the population . Additionally , Singapore is one of the leading countries and territories with the highest life expectancy at birth ; an expectancy of 87.5 years . As such , Singapore is faced with adapting to aging population and a growing ratio of old-age dependency . A trend of population aging Many countries are facing this demographic dilemma : the global median age is projected to grow from 29.6 in 2015 to around 41.6 years through the end of the century . Population aging could be one of the most substantial societal transformations of the twenty-first century , affecting most sectors of society , including healthcare , housing , and pensions .
