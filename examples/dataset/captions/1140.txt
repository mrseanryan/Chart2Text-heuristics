The average price of gel fills in the United States increased moderately in the 2010 's , rising from 29.19 U.S. dollars in 2009 to 34.03 U.S. dollars in 2015 . Gel fills A gel fill is a treatment for nails which already have a gel polish applied , and is designed to fill in the small gap that occurs between the cuticle and the base of the gel polish after several weeks of growth . Gel polishes can either be ‘ soft ' _ , where the treatment does not extend beyond the edge of the natural nail , or ‘ hard ' _ , where a harder form of gel can be used to create nail extensions . A full treatment including nail extensions is significantly more expensive than a soft gel polish . Gel versus acrylic The main alternative to gel-based nail treatments is acrylic treatments . Gel treatments are a relatively new invention compared to acrylic nail treatments , emerging in the 1980 's . Many people prefer gel nail treatments , claiming they have a more natural feeling while providing a longer-lasting , glossier finish with no chipping , peeling or cracking . However , gel nail are more complicated to apply than acrylic treatments , making acrylic fills and full sets cheaper than their gel alternatives . In addition , gels are more difficult to remove , meaning that removal often creates an additional cost – although it is possible to remove gel treatments at home .
