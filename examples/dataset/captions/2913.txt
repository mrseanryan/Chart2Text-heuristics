The amount of fuel used to generate electricity depends on the efficiency of the power plant and the heat content of the fuel . Heat rate measures the efficiency of a generator or power plant and is based on the amount of energy used to generate one kilowatt of electricity . Heat rates ( power plant efficiencies ) depend on generator type , power plant emission controls , and some other factors . One metric ton of coal can generate 1,927 kilowatt hours of electricity , in comparison to 1,000 cubic feet of natural gas which can generate 99 kilowatt hours . U.S. power plants The largest power plant in the United States is the hydroelectric power plant , Grand Coulee , located in Washington . It has a summer capacity of 7.08 gigawatts . Power plant costs can also depend on the type of technology being used as well as the location . The amount of energy generated by renewable technologies can also vary greatly , depending on size , technology , and location potential . For example , the measured efficiency of solar cells can vary greatly depending on the material used . In the United States , about 17.7 percent of electricity generated is derived from renewable sources .
