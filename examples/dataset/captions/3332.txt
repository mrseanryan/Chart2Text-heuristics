Gasoline prices worldwide The price of gasoline is a frequently discussed issue , and is a part of almost everybody 's life in developed countries . Gasoline prices worldwide are dependent of a number of factors : crude oil prices , costs for processing and distribution , demand , strength of currencies , taxation , and availability . The most influential factor is the crude oil price . This price includes the costs for exploration , extraction , and transport . What the consumer pays in the end is also an issue of national oil pricing policy . Typical regions with high taxes on gasoline are European countries and Japan . Other countries keep consumer prices low by subsidizing the costs for gasoline . Among latter countries are the United States , Saudi Arabia , Iran , Venezuela , Egypt , Malaysia , Bolivia , and others . There are many other factors , however , which directly influence the price of gasoline . Wars , crises , and natural disasters in oil producing regions , for example , can obstruct the production and transportation , and thus cause higher crude oil prices . Last but not least , the end-consumer defines the price through his or her demand . A higher number of people driving cars means higher prices for gasoline , which is often the case in the summer months or holiday seasons . The gasoline prices in this statistic are compared based on unleaded premium gasoline ( RON 95 ) for France , Germany , Italy , Spain and the United Kingdom , and regular unleaded gasoline for Canada , Japan and the United States ( AKI 87 ) . RON stands for Research Octane Number , while AKI means Anti-Knock Index . Both represent the most common octane rating in the countries shown .
