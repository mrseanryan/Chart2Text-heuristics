Essent and Energiedirect.nl together served more than three million people in 2018 , making them the largest energy suppliers of the Netherlands . Both are brands from German-based innogy , itself a subsidiary of RWE . Domestic company Eneco , together with its subsidiary Oxxio , reached 2.4 million clients . Dutch households on average paid around 17.07 cents per kWh for electricity . Why can I not find the market shares of energy companies in the Netherlands ? Energy companies in the Netherlands do not have to share their financial data with the local authorities . In 2004 , the government in the Netherlands liberalized the supply of electricity and natural gas , allowing more private energy suppliers to enter the market . Because of this liberalization , there is less data available for the energy market in the Netherlands than in Belgium or Luxembourg . In Luxembourg , for example , Enovos had an electricity market share of 74 percent whereas in Belgium different market shares existed for the three different regions . Are these companies also responsible for the energy infrastructure ? The energy companies mentioned in this ranking are energy suppliers only . The country 's distribution network is maintained by different regional companies . Liander , for example , operates in the Amsterdam area wheras Stedin is active in cities as Rotterdam and Utrecht and most of the South Holland and Utrecht provinces . Enexis operates in five of the 12 Dutch provinces : Groningen , Drenthe , Overijssel , Noord-Brabant ( except for the city of Eindhoven ) and Limburg .
