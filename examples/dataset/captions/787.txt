The statistic shows the estimated total costs of the FIFA World Cup 2014 in Brazil , including the costs for stadium construction and renovation , urban mobility projects , upgrades at airports , public security and military defence forces , port infrastructure , telecommunications networks and services , complementary work for the Confederations Cup and tourism infrastructure projects . The costs for stadium construction and renovation are estimated at around 3.6 billion U.S. dollars . 2014 World Cup costs - additional information The 2014 World Cup in Brazil cost an estimated $ 11.6 billion . Less than 15 % of this cost was covered by private investors , with the rest of the funds coming from federal and state budgets . These figures were updated on average every nine months by the Brazilian government since they were first published in January 2010 . The biggest costs in the 2014 World Cup were the stadiums and the Urban Mobility Projects , which included improvement to the road and transport networks as well as integrated monitoring systems for all host cities . Of the 12 host cities , five had brand new venues built specifically for the tournament while the Est√°dio Nacional in the capital , Brasilia , was demolished and completely rebuilt . The remaining six stadiums were extensively renovated in preparation for the World Cup . With an estimated one million foreign tourists visiting Brazil during the month-long event , substantial investment was also needed in the country 's airports ( $ 2.6 billion ) and public security systems ( $ 797 million ) , as well as in tourist infrastructure projects ( $ 76 million ) . Despite the extensive publicity and income that a World Cup generates for a host nation , with such high costs that ultimately have to be covered by the federal government , it is unsurprising that , before the start of the World Cup , 61 % of Brazilians thought that the tournament would be a bad thing for Brazil .
