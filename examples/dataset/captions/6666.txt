In 2018 , new homes in the United States were , on average , sold for 385,000 U.S. dollars . Home prices have steadily risen since 2011 , after a drop between 2005 and 2011 , which corresponds with the 2007 - 2009 recession . Prices have more or less plateaued since 2017 , so the bubble which began to form in 2011 may be about to burst . Almost one third of homes in the U.S. are worth between 50,000 and 174,999 U.S. dollars , which is considerably less than the average sales price of new homes . When will the next recession hit ? Many industry experts have predicted the next recession is on its way , which would explain the topping out of home prices in recent years . The American public also believe that it will commence in 2020 or by 2025 . House prices are rising faster than incomes are , which has led to many Americans being unable to afford homeownership .
