Unemployment as an economic key indicator The unemployment rate of a country represents the share of people without a job in the country 's labor force , i.e . unemployed persons among those who are able and/or willing to work . Among other factors , it takes population growth into account , and thus increases in the labor force , as well as the age of the population . A high unemployment rate usually indicates economic troubles , with a popular example being Greece , where the unemployment rate skyrocketed from 7.76 percent in 2008 to 27.5 percent as a result of the Great Recession . From plowshares to keyboards While Pakistan 's unemployment slumped below the one percent mark in 2010 , it is now on the rise again and currently standing at just over four percent .
