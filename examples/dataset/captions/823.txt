The statistic shows the growth rate in the real GDP in the United Kingdom from 2014 to 2018 , with projections up until 2024 . In 2018 , the rate of GDP growth in the United Kingdom was at around 1.4 percent compared to the previous year.The economy of the United Kingdom GDP is used an indicator as to the shape of a national economy . It is one of the most regularly called upon measurements regarding the economic fitness of a country . GDP is the total market value of all final goods and services that have been produced in a country within a given period of time , usually a year . Inflation adjusted real GDP figures serve as an even more telling indication of a country 's economic state in that they act as a more reliable and clear tool as to a nation 's economic health . The gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth rate in the United Kingdom has started to level in recent years after taking a huge body blow in the financial collapse of 2008 . The UK managed to rise from the state of dark desperation it was in between 2009 and 2010 , from -3.97 to 1.8 percent . The country suffered acutely from the collapse of the banking industry , raising a number of questions within the UK with regards to the country 's heavy reliance on revenues coming from London 's financial sector , arguably the most important in the world and one of the globe 's financial command centers . Since the collapse of the post-war consensus and the rise of Thatcherism , the United Kingdom has been swept along in a wave of individualism - collective ideals have been abandoned and the mass privatisation of the heavy industries was unveiled - opening them up to market competition and shifting the economic focus to that of service . The Big Bang policy , one of the cornerstones of the Thatcher government programs of reform , involved mass and sudden deregulation of financial markets . This led to huge changes in the way the financial markets in London work , and saw the many old firms being absorbed by big banks . This , one could argue , strengthened the UK financial sector greatly and while frivolous and dangerous practices brought the sector into great disrepute , the city of London alone brings in around one fifth of the countries national income making it a very prominent contributor to wealth in the UK .
