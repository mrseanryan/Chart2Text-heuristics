National debt and GDP The debt-to-GDP ratio is an indicator of a country 's ability to produce and sell goods in order to pay back any present debts , however these countries should not retain newer debts in the process . Many economists believe that if a country is able to produce more without impairing its own economical growth , it can be considered more stable , particularly for the future . However , the listed countries , with the exception of Russia and Saudi Arabia , are not necessarily economic first-world powers . Additionally , economically powerful countries such as the United States and France maintain one of the highest debt-to-GDP ratios , signifying that occurring debt does not necessarily damage the state of the economy and is sometimes necessary in order to help develop it . Saudi Arabia has maintained one of the lowest debt-to-GDP ratios due to its high export rates , which primarily consist of petroleum and petroleum goods . Given the significance of oil in today 's world , Saudi Arabia produces enough oil and earns enough revenue to maintain a high GDP and additionally refrain from incurring debt .
