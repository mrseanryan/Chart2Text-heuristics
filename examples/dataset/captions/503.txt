Price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil WTI is a grade of crude oil also known as `` Texas light sweet . '' It is measured to have an API gravity of around 39.6 and specific gravity of about 0.83 , which is considered `` light '' relative to other crude oils . This oil also contains roughly 0.24 percent sulfur , and is therefore named `` sweet . '' WTI is used as an oil pricing benchmark .

The price of other crude oils , such as UK Brent crude oil , the OPEC crude oil basket , and Dubai Fateh oil , can be compared to that of WTI crude oil .

The price of WTI is volatile , as a timeline of the monthly price development of West Texas Intermediate crude oil shows . The price of oil is controlled in part by limiting oil production . Prior to 1971 , the Texas Railroad Commission controlled the price of oil by setting limits on production of U.S. oil . In 1971 , the Texas Railroad Commission ceased limiting production , but OPEC , the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries with member states Iran , Iraq , Kuwait , Saudi Arabia , and Venezuela among others , continued to do so . In 1972 , due to geopolitical conflict , OPEC set an oil embargo and cut oil production , causing prices to quadruple by 1974 . Oil prices rose again in 1979 and 1980 due to the Iranian revolution , and doubled between 1978 and 1981 as the Iran-Iraq War prevented oil production . A number of geopolitical conflicts and periods of increased production and consumption have influenced the price of oil since the 1980s .
