South Korea 's low inflation High rates of inflation are undesireable , just like low rates , and South Korea is currently struggling with the latter . South Korea is actually an affluent country and currently ranks 11th on the list of the 20 countries with the largest GDP , but its inflation rate is subject to concern , as it is currently at levels below 2 percent . However , there is still hope that inflation will return to stable rates between 3 and 4.5 percent in the next few years , and there are also signs that consumer confidence is rising after two years of weak economic growth and sluggish domestic consumption and investment . The unemployment rate remains low with levels staying in the range of 3 percent - close to full employment â€“ yet there are still obstacles including an aging population and a heavy reliance on exports . At present , South Korea is attempting to balance its reliance on exports by expanding the service industry , especially as the export market slows .
