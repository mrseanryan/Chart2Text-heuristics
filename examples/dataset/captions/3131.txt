In 2018 , in terms of population , the biggest cities or municipalities in Belgium were Antwerp , Ghent , Charleroi , Liège , and Brussels . The Flemish cities of Antwerp and Ghent were the most populated in Belgium in 2018 . From a regional perspective , out of the 7 million people living in Flanders , around 800 thousand people lived in one of these two cities . However , the region of Wallonia also had large cities such as Charleroi and Liège . For instance , both cities registered around 200 thousand inhabitants each . To put all these numbers into perspective , Belgium 's population amounted to 11.4 million in 2018 . Belgium 's capital city : Brussels Surprisingly , the Belgian capital , Brussels , was not on top of the list . The reason for this is in the way the city 's population is measured . Brussels is made of 19 municipalities . In this ranking , for instance , only three of them are listed : Brussels City , Schaerbeek , and Anderlecht . These 19 municipalities form the heart of the agglomeration of Brussels which counts 36 municipalities in total and is also known as `` le Grand Bruxelles '' . In 2019 , over a million people were living in this Brussels-Capital Region . The agglomeration of Brussels is the most populated in the country , it is bigger than the agglomeration of Antwerp . Yet in terms of municipalities , Antwerp was the most populated in Belgium in 2018 . Belgium 's five big agglomerations Belgium faced a population growth of 0.45 percent in 2017 . The country counts five big agglomerations : Antwerp , Brussels , Charleroi , Ghent , and Liège . Although the notion of agglomeration is very fluid and disputed , each of these five agglomerations represents a significant part of the population . For some , agglomerations are defined by the continuity of constructions . For others , they are defined by the sense of an urban entity shared by a living community . Nonetheless , the definition of an agglomeration in Belgium corresponds to the European rules . These rules fix the technical specifications regarding the population and housing census . An agglomeration is , therefore , a group of municipalities which includes a continuously built-up zone with no cut of more than 200 meters between two constructions .
