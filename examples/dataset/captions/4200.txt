In 2019 , the issues believed by the global exhibition industry to be most important were economic , with 24 percent of survey respondents citing the economy in their home market , and 19 percent citing global economic developments , as the most important issue for the industry . The exhibition industry The exhibition industry is a somewhat broad concept , including all organized events to present or display a selection of some type of item . At one end of the spectrum this includes public exhibitions of art or history in a gallery or museum , while at the other end are trade fairs , where goods and services associated with a specific industry are exhibited to invited guests only . Despite the variations both sides of the industry are business-focused – the most popular art exhibitions can attract upwards of a million visitors , while the trade fair industry generated global revenues of over 30 billion U.S. dollars in 2016 . Trade fairs In many respects , the challenges facing the trade show industry are more complex than that facing the art and history exhibitions , given the restricted supply of items to be exhibited for the latter . Technological developments such as digital advertising social media may reduce the need for physical shows to create product awareness – although the two are not mutually exclusive , as the internet can also be used to promote exhibitions . The face-to-face nature of trade shows also provides a unique opportunity for networking . Interestingly , while the trade fair industry is largest in the United States , the largest trade fair organizers tend to be European companies .
