Spain is gradually becoming older , or so it seems when looking at the latest studies which forecast that the average Spaniard would be 52.3 years old by the year 2050 . The Mediterranean country featured a median age of 27.5 years old in 1950 , but this trend shifted towards a steady ageing of the Spanish population in the subsequent years . Spain 's median age was expected to reach approximately 45 years by 2020 . The depopulation of a country The population of Spain has been in decline for many years and was projected to decrease by nearly one million by 2023 . This will not come as a surprise since Spain has the lowest fertility rate in the European Union , with barely 1.34 children per woman according to the latest reports . During the last ten years , the country featured a continuous population density of approximately 93 inhabitants per square kilometer â€“ a figure far from the European average , which stood nearly at 121 inhabitants per square kilometer in 2017 . Ageing : a common problem across the continent Data related to age in the Mediterranean country essentially behave in a similar fashion as the rest of its European counterparts , whose population is also slowly but surely getting older . This will not come as a surprise since Spain has one of the highest life expectancies at birth in the world and the lowest European fertility rate , which stood at 1.34 children per woman according to the latest reports .
