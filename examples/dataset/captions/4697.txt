This graph depicts the revenue forecasts for the U.S. toys and games market from 2009 to 2014 . Estimated revenue for 2010 is 21.98 billion U.S. dollars . U.S. Toys and Games Market The toys and games market comprises a wide range of products , including art and craft , building and other learning and hobby sets/toys , dolls , jigsaw , board and card games , action figures , die cast models , soft toys and outdoor games and sports toys/games . Traditional toy sales are suffering due to the growing popularity of the computer games market ; however , this is somewhat balanced by a constant demand for infants ' toys . Toys and games are not necessities but rather viewed as a treat of which frequency and cost is dependent on the affluence of the buyer . Grandparents of the baby-boomer generations are generally wealthier than in previous generations , especially in developed nations , and are able to spoil their grandchildren to a greater extent . The popularity of many toys and games is short-lived and/or seasonal , which means the retail market is subject to rapid change . It is becoming increasingly challenging for independent toy stores to compete with mass merchandisers and department stores , as these types of stores are able to exploit economies of scale to offer low prices . However , the biggest threat and the most significant substitutes to the toys and games market are computer games . Children are playing computer games at a lower age in an increasingly digital world . Consoles , PCs and mobile phones are playing an ever growing part in children 's lives by providing games , education and entertainment . Despite not providing a cheaper alternative on the whole , computer games are becoming more popular to the detriment of traditional toys and games where customer loyalty is low with no switching costs . The toys and games market is generally fragmented , with numerous retailers present , boosting the competition within this market . Some market players are highly dependent on revenues from toys and games sales , with department stores and supermarkets being less dependent than specialized toy stores , due to the variety of goods on offer .
