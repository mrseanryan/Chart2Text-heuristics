In a span of fifteen years , the population density of Singapore increased by approximately 1.75 thousand people per square kilometer of land area , to approximately 7.87 thousand people per square kilometer . This is due to the population of Singapore increasing over the years within a very limited space . Limited land , expanding population With a population of around 5.7 million people in 2019 and a land area of approximately 720 square kilometers , Singapore was the second most densely populated country in the world , after Monaco . This is not expected to ease in the near future , with the population of Singapore estimated to grow to 6.52 million people in 2035 . While this might not come close to the population size of other Asian metropolises such as Tokyo or Bangkok , the lack of land available for development poses a great challenge to the island city-state . Since its independence in 1965 , Singapore has increased its land area from 581.5 square kilometers to its current size through land reclamation . However , Singapore 's proximity to Malaysia and the Riau Islands in Indonesia effectively limit the available area for reclamation to its maritime borders . The importance of urban planning Urban planning in Singapore must therefore make effective use of what little land is available without compromising livability . Most residents live in apartments situated in high-rise buildings , with 82 percent of the population living in public housing provided by the Housing Development Board . Rooftop gardens , tree-lined roads and green innovations such as vertical farming and `` breathing walls '' help soften the presence of all that glass and concrete , earning Singapore its moniker of `` Garden City '' . Whether and how well Singapore can sustain the quality of life that its residents are used to with an ever-increasing population density in the next twenty years is , however , to be seen .
