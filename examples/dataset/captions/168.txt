This statistic shows the countries with the largest lithium reserves worldwide as estimated in 2019 . In that year , it was estimated that the United States had total lithium reserves of approximately 630,000 metric tons . Lithium reserves by country Lithium is a soft , silver-white metal within the alkali metal group on the periodic table . In nature , lithium occurs only in compounds due to its high reactivity . Chile had the largest lithium reserves worldwide in 2019 by a large margin . Chile had an estimated 8.6 million metric tons of lithium reserves . Australia came in second with reserves estimated at 2.8 million metric tons . Mineral reserves are defined as those minerals that were extractable or producible at the time of estimate . Australia was the top country in terms of lithium mine production in 2019 , producing 42,000 metric tons of lithium that year . Lithium is used primarily in batteries , glass and ceramics , with other uses including rocket fuel and lasers . The global lithium battery market is projected to grow substantially in coming years , from 30 billion U.S. dollars in 2017 to over 100 billion U.S. dollars by 2025 . The electric vehicle market will propel the growth of the lithium market as the number of hybrid and electric vehicles powered by rechargeable lithium batteries picks up . In 2018 the top producers of lithium battery cells were estimated to be Panasonic Sanyo , CATL , BYD , and LG Chem . It is expected that Germany , China , Japan , and France will be leading electric vehicle producing countries .
