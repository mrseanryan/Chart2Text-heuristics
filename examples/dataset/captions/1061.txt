Prices in New Zealand rose by 1.6 percent in 2018 . After a dip in the following year , inflation was forecast to remain steady around 2 percent for the foreseeable future . Central bankers at the Reserve Bank of New Zealand were surely relieved to see the rebound from the dangerously low .31 percent inflation in 2015 . What is inflation ? Inflation is the rise in price levels in an economy . 2 percent inflation means 100 New Zealand dollars will be worth 98 dollars in one year . While the precise inflation target varies , most economists agree that inflation between 2 to 3 percent is optimal for an economy . High inflation can lead to higher unemployment because firms would rather wait and higher workers at the same price using future dollars , making the labor relatively cheaper . However , it affects the trade balance because of the relatively higher purchasing power of foreign currencies . Other risks of inflation and deflation Inflation helps a country with higher national debt when the debt is in the local currency , because the country can repay with the future dollars which are relatively cheaper . Deflation , then , helps when debts are in a foreign currency . The main problem with deflation is that investors prefer to hold their money , waiting to invest until it is worth more . This is particularly true of countries like New Zealand , where the lion 's share of employment is in the services sector .
