In 2019 , the estimated youth unemployment rate in Nigeria was at almost 20 percent . According to the source , the data are estimates from the International Labour Organization , an agency of the United Nations developing policies to set labor standards . Employment in Nigeria The youth unemployment rate refers to the percentage of the unemployed in the age group of 15 to 24 years as compared to the total labor force . Youth unemployment rates are often higher than overall unemployment rates , which is true in Nigeria as well : the general rate of unemployment was approximately six percent in 2018 . One reason for this contrast is that many of the youth under age 24 are studying full-time and are unavailable for work due to this . Education in Nigeria Nigeria 's population has a large percentage of young inhabitants , and there is a high demand for educational opportunities for its young populace . After severe cuts in governmental aid following a nationwide recession in 2016 , Nigeria 's underfunded higher education system became the focus of ongoing student protests and strikes . Other families have taken a different approach : Nigeria is the top country of origin for international students from the continent of Africa . For example , Nigeria sent over 12,600 students to the U.S. in 2017/18 , the most of any African country .
