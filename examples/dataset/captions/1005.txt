The statistic shows the inflation rate in Spain from 1984 to 2018 , with projections up until 2024 . The inflation rate is calculated using the price increase of a defined product basket . This product basket contains products and services , on which the average consumer spends money throughout the year . They include expenses for groceries , clothes , rent , power , telecommunications , recreational activities and raw materials ( e.g . gas , oil ) , as well as federal fees and taxes . In 2018 , the average inflation rate in Spain increased by about 1.68 percent compared to the previous year . Inflation in Spain As explained briefly above , inflation is commonly defined as the level of prices for goods and services in a country 's economy over a certain time span . It increases when the total money supply of a country increases , causing the money 's value to decrease , and prices to increase again in turn . Nowadays the term `` inflation '' is used more or less synonymously with `` price level increase '' . Its opposite is deflation , which , in short , means a decrease of the price level . Spain and its economy have been severely affected by the financial crisis of 2008 ( as can be seen above ) , when the real estate bubble imploded and caused the demand for goods and services to decrease and the unemployment rate in Spain to increase dramatically . Even though deflation only occurred for one year in 2009 and the price level has been increasing since , Spain 's economy still has a long way to go until full recovery . Apart from the inflation rate and the unemployment rate , gross domestic product / GDP growth in Spain and the trade balance of goods in Spain , i.e . the exports of goods minus the imports , are additional indicators of Spain 's desolate condition during the economic crisis and its slow and difficult recovery ever since . Still , there is a silver lining for Spain 's economy . All in all , things seems to be improving economically , albeit slowly ; many key indicators are starting to stabilize or even pick up again , while others still have some recovering to do .
