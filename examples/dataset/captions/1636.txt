While nearly two-thirds of Vietnam remains rural , urbanization has grown by seven percent from 2008 to 2018 . Political reforms in the 1980s created greater economic stability in Vietnam in the decade that followed and led to higher urbanization . The growing population of Vietnam , as well as people migrating from rural areas , contributes to an escalating number of inhabitants in the country 's already crowded cities . Agricultural sector becoming less prominent In 2008 , nearly half the population of Vietnam worked in agriculture . Ten years later , as more people leave rural areas , the service sector is comparable in size , employing roughly a third of the population , while employment in the industry sector has grown to a quarter . Though agriculture has long had the most workers , the service and industry sectors accounted for larger shares of Vietnam 's GDP from 2007 to 2017 . Costs in rural and urban areas In rural areas of Vietnam , investment in agriculture – such as the costs of farming – was the second-highest expense in 2019 . In urban areas , around the same share was spent on aspirational living costs such as eating out and holidays , while investment was the category with the least amount of monthly spending . The expense associated with farming in rural areas is a possible cause for the increased migration to cities , with fewer people employed in the agricultural sector and more working in services such as health care , education , hospitality , and gastronomy .
