It is expected that by 2023 , around 62.5 million Filipinos will become users of a social network . Considering the forecasted population of around 118 million , it reflects the high popularity of social media in the Philippines . Current state of social media in the Philippines The Philippines have been called the social media capital of the world , because most of the social media users have an extraordinarily high usage time of about four hours per day . Additionally , they are known as early technology adopters , as well as being highly internet-savvy . Yet the infrastructure can not keep up with the population 's needs . The archipelago consists of around seven thousand islands , making it difficult for the government to provide basic connectivity . As of 2017 , around 64 million out of 105 million inhabitants had internet access . While 81 percent of the 18- to 24-year-olds were already online , only twelve percent of those aged 55 years and older were able to access the internet . How are the Philippines able to improve their accessibility ? Since it is widely recognized that internet access has an impact on economic growth , local authorities must focus on further expanding the network . There are few promising technologies to do so : fiber cables could be installed and even reduce the cost of telecommunication companies in the end . The upcoming 5G network could help connect remote areas with a trustworthy connection , and if that is too far into the future , satellites could be a viable choice for now ; they are able to reach every point on the earth , making them key for achieving nationwide connectivity .
