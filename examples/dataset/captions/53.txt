Twitter Twitter is a social networking and microblogging service , enabling registered users to read and post short messages called tweets . Twitter messages are limited to 280 characters and users are also able to upload photos or short videos . Tweets are posted to a publicly available profile or can be sent as direct messages to other users . Part of the social platform 's appeal is the ability of users to follow any other user with a public profile , enabling users to interact with celebrities who regularly post on the social media site . Currently , the most-followed person on Twitter is singer Katy Perry with more than 107 million followers . Twitter has also become an important communications channel for governments and heads of state â€“ U.S. President Donald Trump was the most-followed world leader on Twitter , followed by Pope Francis and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi . Despite the widespread usage among the rich and famous , the decline in active users has not been impressing investors as the platform is largely reliant on delivering advertising to users in order to generate revenues . Twitter 's company revenue in 2018 amounted to three billion U.S. dollars , up from 2.44 billion in the preceding fiscal year . Twitter was only recently able to report a positive annual result for the first time , when the company generated 1.2 billion U.S. dollars in net income in 2018 .
