This statistic represents the size of the global biofuels market in 2016 , with a forecasted figure for 2023 . In 2016 , the global biofuels market was sized at around 101 billion U.S. dollars . Biofuels market size As car drivers were becoming increasingly worried about sky-high gasoline prices and the level of pollution in urban areas , alternative fuels began to make inroads in the automotive industry . Political decision makers introduced tax credits for gasoline-ethanol mixtures , and petrol stations started selling gasoline grades where up to 10 percent of ethanol was blended into conventional petrol . As a result , corn and sugar cane farmers in the rural U.S. soon emerged as the major beneficiaries of the biofuels movement in the United States , which established itself as a driving force in the biofuels market . In 2016 , the United States was ranked as the largest biofuel producing country , followed by Brazil and Germany . Globally , the implementation of a biofuels market soon sparked a food versus fuel debate among critics . While advocates saw biofuels as part of a clean and sustainable energy future , others argued that fuels should not be derived from edible plants . However , the biofuels market continued to be resilient . In 2016 , the global market for the production and wholesale pricing of ethanol and biodiesel was sized at close to 101 billion US dollars . By 2023 , the market is expected to grow to almost 133 billion U.S. dollars . Revenue growth is projected to be driven by capacity additions and higher prices for alternative fuels .
