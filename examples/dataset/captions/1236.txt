The electric bike market is expected to reach almost 24 billion U.S. dollars in 2025 . This translates into a CAGR of between four and five percent over this period . Shaking off the bad rep Electric bicycles continue to enjoy a surge in popularity ; what was once seen as very unfashionable is now becoming a common sight , from rural areas to modern cities . The power-assisted form of the common bicycle has supposedly been able to attract users who previously would not have wished to cycle , i.e . those who may have struggled with hills without the extra power or commuters who preferred an easy drive to work . Once hesitant users go for a ride , their perception of cycling tends to turn positive , and yet , the sudden acceptance of electric bicycles has also been attributed to the fact that professional athletes are heaping praise on electric bike . Considering that e-bikes sell for more than four times the price of traditional bicycles , it is an investment that should be made use of . Large markets across the globe The Asia Pacific is the largest e-bike market , but the European market did grow substantially with EU sales doubling by 2016 to reach nearly 1.7 million units . Although some countries within Europe hit the craze earlier than others , such as the Netherlands , there was a distinct boom in 2016 across many European countries . In the United States , only 17 percent of citizens knew what an e-bike was in 2017 , but electric bicycles are predicted to break into the U.S. market eventually , with 280,000 unites predicted to be sold in 2024 .
