What is the price of a house in Belgium ? In 2018 , a house in Belgium would cost approximately 251,584 euros . This is an increase of roughly 4.7 percent compared to the previous year and an increase of approximately 11 percent compared to 2014 . Note , however , that there are large price differences between the three Belgian regions . A house in the Brussels Capital-Region ( the city of Brussels along and its surrounding villages ) costed around 453,000 euros in 2018 . Dutch-speaking Flanders and French-speaking Wallonia reached average prices of 277,000 euros and 189,000 euros respectively . Of the Belgian provinces , houses in Hainaut were the cheapest . The ranking shown here only includes what in Flemish Dutch is referred to as `` woonhuizen '' and as `` maisons '' in French and therefore does not include apartments . How much is an apartment in Belgium ? In 2018 , an apartment in Belgium would cost approximately 220,000 euros . Apartment prices increased by 1.8 percent compared to 2017 , which is lower than the house prices ( 4.7 percent ) . The source mentions that Flanders and the Brussels Capital-Region are the main drivers behind this , as apartment prices increased by 1.6 percent and 2.4 percent respectively . Wallonia remained stable at +0.5 percent . Is residential property in Belgium expensive when compared to the rest of Europe ? The house price index ( HPI ) of Belgium did not increase as fast as that of other European countries in 2018 . Residential property in Belgium ( which includes both newly constructed as well as existing property ) increased by 2.6 percent between the third quarter of 2017 and the third quarter of 2018 , whereas prices in Slovenia and the Netherlands increased by more than ten percent . When the HPI is corrected for inflation , however , numbers show that only Swedish and Luxembourgish housing was more expensive than those in Belgium .
