In 2018 , the GDP per capita in Spain was around 30,733.17 U.S. dollars . Spain 's struggling economy The Spanish economy is essential for the global market , as it remains one of the largest economies in the world as well as within Europe . The aftermath of the global financial crisis and the Eurozone crisis resulted in an economic collapse , which has yet to be completely resolved by the Spanish government . While unemployment has always been a general weakness for Spain , the occurrence of recent economic disasters has fueled the struggles in the country 's job market , resulting in a decade high unemployment rate . During the prime of both crises , not only millions of workers were laid off , but government spending also reached a new high , considerably exceeding national revenues earned . This not only resulted in further layoffs in the following years , but also burdened the country with almost double the amount of debt . Prior to the crisis , the public already assumed that the Spanish economy would decline , however the public opinion of the situation became conclusive post 2009 . The lack of consumer confidence is only further damaging the Spanish economy , as investors have already pulled much capital from the troubled nation and are hesitant to reinvest their money .
