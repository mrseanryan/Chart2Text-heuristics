In the third quarter of 2019 , the debt to equity ratio in the United States amounted to 84.18 percent . Debt to equity ratio explained The debt to equity financial ratio indicates the relationship between shareholders ' equity and debt used to finance the assets of a company . In order to make the calculation the data of the two required components are taken from the firm 's balance sheet . If the company is a publicly traded company then it is possible to make the calculation by taking the market value for both . The composition of debt and equity of an enterprise is much debated as is the influence that it is able to exert on the value of the firm . Nevertheless , it is important in helping investors such as banks to identify companies that are highly leveraged and therefore pose a higher risk . It is best explained by taking the example of an entrepreneur wishing to expand their operation and going to the bank for a loan . If this small business owner had total assets amounting to 120,000 U.S. dollars and liabilities ( mostly loans ) amounting to 100,000 U.S. dollars the bank to which the request is being made would first have to deduce the business owner 's equity ; 20,000 dollars ( total assets minus liabilities ) . With this figure the bank would proceed to divide total liabilities by equity , which gives the ratio of 500 percent . In other terms , this means that for every one dollar of equity the small business owner has 5 dollars of debt . He is highly leveraged and therefore represents high risk to the bank .
