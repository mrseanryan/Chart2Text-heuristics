This statistic shows the total population of Italy from 2014 to 2018 , with projections up until 2024 . In 2018 , the total population of Italy was around 60.48 million people . See Switzerland 's population figures for comparison . The largest city in Italy , with the largest amount of inhabitants , is Rome , with almost 3 million inhabitants . Population of Italy Although the population in Italy has continuously grown year over year , population growth has significantly slowed down since 2004 . It can be assumed that a decrease in population growth is related to a decrease in immigrants , especially considering that the fertility rate in the country has remained relatively stable over the past decade . A decrease in immigrants and a potential increase in emigrations could , in return , be a result of the country 's slumping economy . Many aspects of Italy 's economy have suffered as a result of the 2008 financial crisis : Italy 's unemployment rate has increased severely , most notably between 2011 and 2012 and this trend is expected to continue over the next several years . Additionally , the country 's gross domestic product ( GDP ) has since decreased and has struggled to maintain stability . This is most evident in Italy 's real GDP growth rate . Not only is the growth rate minimal , but Italy has also experienced several years of negative growth , especially in 2009 . However , despite a struggling economy , the standard of living in Italy has remained affluent . In 2012 , Italy was ranked as one of the 30 countries with the highest Human Development Index rating . The Human Development Index , also known as the HDI , is based on values of life expectancy at birth , literacy rate , education levels and gross national income per capita . Italy has one of the highest life expectancies in the world as of 2011 , ranking 6th out of the top 20 countries .
