What is the revenue of Bol.com ? In 2018 , net consumer sales on the online marketplace ( including both the Netherlands and Belgium ) were worth 2.1 billion euros , an increase of more than 32 percent to the previous year . Net consumer online sales are online sales including sales by third parties on the platform . Much like on Amazon , sales on the Dutch website can either come from the retailer itself , third parties or from a second-hand goods section . As of 2018 , 36 percent of survey respondents in the Netherlands reported to use this second-hand part of the website . Bol.com and Coolblue are the Netherlands ' leading web shops One might expect Amazon to be the biggest online store in the Netherlands , as this company can be found all over the world and is active in multiple European countries . In a ranking based on revenue made by direct online sales , however , Amazon was believed to be only the seventh online retailer of the Netherlands . Bol.com topped the list , followed by electronics retailer Coolblue . The total revenue of this Rotterdam-based web shop was around 1.3 billion euros in 2018 . The Dutch tend to do their online purchases domestically Compared to other European countries , Dutch consumers are less likely to buy online from foreign retailers . This might be caused by two reasons . First , the Bol.com brand ( as well as the supermarket brand Albert Heijn , which have the same owner ) is a household name in Dutch society and people are familiar with it . Another reason might be in the ease of use : like most Dutch online e-commerce retailers , Bol.com offers iDEAL ( which allows Dutch shoppers to use their bank debit cards for online purchases ) as a payment method .
