Both focused on matters of health and hygiene as they were indirectly promoting sanitizing products . Savlon sponsored soap-infused chalk , which was intended to encourage children in India to keep their hands clean . The campaign was created by Ogilvy Mumbai and upon being shown on national and international media reached roughly six million people . At the same time , McCann New Delhi was hired to develop an advertising campaign for a toilet disinfectant brand Harpic which would specifically target Indian families . The agency came up with an idea to draw attention to the lack of sufficient sanitary appliances in India 's households . Using classifieds and matrimonial ads , they managed to transform a simple fact of owning a toilet into a status symbol . As a result , the presence of a toilet in a home was a must before accepting a marriage proposal . That year more than five million new toilets were added to rural households in the country , in turn creating a larger market for Harpic . Both McCann and Ogilvy are in the top five of the most creative agency networks worldwide .
