In 2018 , the growth in real gross domestic product ( GDP ) in China amounted to about 6.6 percent . Forecasts until 2024 by the IMF expect declining growth rates in the coming years . Real GDP growth The current gross domestic product is an important indicator of the economic strength of a country . It refers to the total market value of all goods and services that are produced within a country per year . When analyzing year-on-year changes , the current GDP is adjusted for inflation , thus making it constant . Real GDP growth is regarded as a key indicator for economic growth as it incorporates constant GDP figures . As of 2019 , China was among the leading countries with the largest gross domestic product worldwide , second only to the United States which had a GDP volume of almost 21.5 trillion U.S. dollars . The Chinese GDP has shown remarkable growth over the past years . Upon closer examination of the distribution of GDP across economic sectors , a gradual shift from an economy heavily based on industrial production towards an economy focused on services becomes visible , with the service industry outpacing the manufacturing sector in terms of GDP contribution . Key indicator balance of trade Another important indicator for economic assessment is the balance of trade , which measures the relationship between imports and exports of a nation . As an economy heavily reliant on manufacturing and industrial production , China has reached a trade surplus over the last decade , with a total trade balance of around 351 billion U.S. dollars in 2018 .
