The statistic depicts the total population of Mexico from 2014 to 2018 , with projections up until 2024 . In 2018 , Mexico 's total population amounted to about 124.74 million people . Total population of Mexico The total population of Mexico was expected to reach 116.02 million people by the end of 2013 . Despite being the source of one of the largest migration flows in the world , Mexico has managed to maintain around a 1.25 percent population growth rate for the last several years , roughly the same growth rate as India . Among the largest cities in Mexico , Mexico City is leading with more than 8.5 million inhabitants . A slowly declining fertility rate still holds above the replacement rate , and life expectancy is growing , expanding the population from both ends of the age spectrum . With the rising life expectancy , the median age of Mexican residents has also increased , and an increasing stream of immigrants from the financially-troubled Spain has also boosted population numbers . The majority of the Mexican population is Roman Catholic , owing to its colonial Spanish background . Spanish is the predominant language , with several regional and local dialects spoken , but a number of indigenous languages , such as Nahuatl , survive and are also spoken around Mexico . One worrying and relatively recent trend in Mexico is the growing share of the population becoming overweight or obese . It is not entirely clear what sort of effect the obesity epidemic is going to have on Mexican population numbers in the long run , but is starting to manifest itself not just in physical appearance , but in the increased rates of heart disease , hypertension , and diabetes . In fact , diabetes was one of the top causes of deaths for Mexicans in recent years .
