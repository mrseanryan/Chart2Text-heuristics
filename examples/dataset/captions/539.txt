Inflation in Argentina was 34 percent in 2018 , expected to rise to nearly 44 percent the following year before declining to 6 percent by 2024 . A major factor in this is the legacy of poor fiscal discipline left by the economic depression from 1998 to 2002 . What causes inflation ? Inflation is a rise in price levels for all goods . Major causes of inflation include an increase in money supply , low central bank interest rates , and expectation of inflation . In a country such as Argentina , the expectation can be one of the biggest obstacles . People expect inflation to be high and demand increasing wages , and firms continue raising prices because they expect the costs of inputs to increase . Banks follow suit , charging high interest rates on fixed deposits . Effects of inflation Inflation negatively affects savers . 100 Argentinian pesos in 2018 will be worth just under 75 pesos in 2019 , after adjusting for the 34 percent inflation rate . Similarly , frequently changing prices has its own inherent cost , called `` menu cost '' after the price of printing new menus . Inflation will also have a positive effect on national debt when that debt is denominated in Argentinian pesos , because the pesos will be cheaper when the loan matures . However , the majority of Argentina 's debts are in foreign currency , which means that inflation will make these debts larger in peso terms .
