As of 2020 , Amazon was the most valuable brand in the world with an estimated brand value of about 221 billion U.S. dollars . Google , which was the second leading brand in the world , had a brand value of about 160 billion U.S. dollars that year . Brand value Brand value , not to be mistaken with brand equity , is a phrase used in the marketing industry to describe the value of brands based on the implication that the owner of a well-known brand name can generate more money than from products with a less well known name , brand valuation is the estimation of a brands total value . This is achieved by following the International Organization for Standardization 's ISO 10668 standard which maps out the appropriate process of valuing brands by adhering to six key requirements : transparency , validity , reliability , sufficiency , objectivity and financial , behavioral and legal parameters . A brand is an intangible asset ( name , term , design , symbol or any other feature ) identifies one seller 's product from another and is often a corporation 's most valued asset . Strong brands enhance business performance primarily through their influence on three key stakeholder groups : ( current and prospective ) customers , employees and investors . They influence customer choice and create loyalty ; attract , retain , and motivate talent ; and lower the cost of financing . For example , Google is one of the most recognized brands in the world . In North America alone the brand 's value amounted to approximately 313.3 billion U.S. dollars in 2019 . Ultimately , brands help shape perceptions and , therefore , purchasing behavior , making products and service less substitutable . Brands , therefore , create economic value by generating higher returns and growth , and by mitigating risk .
