The statistic shows the 20 countries with the lowest fertility rates in 2017 . All figures are estimates . In 2017 , the fertility rate in Singapore was estimated to be at 0.83 children per woman , making it the lowest fertility rate worldwide . Fertility rate The fertility rate is the average number of children born per woman of child-bearing age in a country . Usually , a woman aged between 15 and 45 is considered to be in her child-bearing years . The fertility rate of a country provides an insight into its economic state , as well as the level of health and education of its population . Developing countries usually have a higher fertility rate due to lack of access to birth control and contraception , and to women usually foregoing a higher education , or even any education at all , in favor of taking care of housework . Many families in poorer countries also need their children to help provide for the family by starting to work early and/or as caretakers for their parents in old age . In developed countries , fertility rates and birth rates are usually much lower , as birth control is easier to obtain and women often choose a career before becoming a mother . Additionally , if the number of women of child-bearing age declines , so does the fertility rate of a country . As can be seen above , countries like Hong Kong are a good example for women leaving the patriarchal structures and focusing on their own career instead of becoming a mother at a young age , causing a decline of the country 's fertility rate . A look at the fertility rate per woman worldwide by income group also shows that women with a low income tend to have more children than those with a high income . The United States are neither among the countries with the lowest , nor among those with the highest fertility rate , by the way . At 2.08 children per woman , the fertility rate in the US has been continuously slightly below the global average of about 2.4 children per woman over the last decade .
