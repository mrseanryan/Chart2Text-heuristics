The postseason of the NFL is when things start to get really interesting – the knockout nature of the games with a place at the Super Bowl on the line means that the tension is ramped up . The New England Patriots seem to be unfazed by this added pressure as they have notched up an impressive 37 wins during the postseason , marking an NFL record . Playoff mainstays While the Patriots have notched up the most wins in NFL postseason history , it is the Dallas Cowboys who have made the most playoff appearances – their 33 appearances are just one more than the number of times the Green Bay Packers and the New York Giants have made it to the knockout stages . The New England Patriots , one of the most successful teams in NFL history , are surprisingly low down the list with 26 playoff appearances . This can be attributed to the fact that the Patriots only made it to 10 playoffs before the turn of the millennium . However , since the turn of the century , the New England franchise has made 16 appearances , only missing out in the 2002 and 2008 seasons . What caused this reversal of fortunes for the New England Patriots ? The Patriots ' main man When you think of the New England Patriots in the last twenty years , you think of only one man – Tom Brady . The legendary quarterback has won a record 30 playoff games with the Patriots , almost double the number of wins of his closest quarterback rival , Joe Montana . Brady has been involved in every single one of the Patriots ' six Super Bowl wins , making him the first player in history to have won six Super Bowls . He also sits a very respectable fourth place on the list of players with the most passing yards in NFL history , behind only fellow legendary quarterbacks , Drew Brees , Peyton Manning , and Brett Favre .
