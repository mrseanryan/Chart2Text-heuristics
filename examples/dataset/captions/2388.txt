Additionally , the Home Ownership Scheme exists in Hong Kong . It is a government sponsored program that subsidizes public housing in Hong Kong . First created in the late 1970s , it was instituted with two targets in mind . The first was to persuade the richer tenants of these apartments to leave so families in greater need could live there . The second was to allow these families to become home owners , since they did not have enough money to buy in the private sector . Under this program , the government sells apartments to qualified low-income tenants at prices below the market value .
