This statistic shows the 20 countries  with the highest infant mortality rate in 2017 . An estimated 110.6 infants per 1,000 live births died in the first year of life in Afghanistan in 2017 . Infant and child mortality Infant mortality usually refers to the death of children younger than one year . Child mortality , which is often used synonymously with infant mortality , is the death of children younger than five . Among the main causes are pneumonia , diarrhea – which causes dehydration – and infections in newborns , with malnutrition also posing a severe problem . As can be seen above , most countries with a high infant mortality rate are developing countries or emerging countries , most of which are located in Africa . Good health care and hygiene are crucial in reducing child mortality ; among the countries with the lowest infant mortality rate are exclusively developed countries , whose inhabitants usually have access to clean water and comprehensive health care . Access to vaccinations , antibiotics and a balanced nutrition also help reducing child mortality in these regions . In some countries , infants are killed if they turn out to be of a certain gender . India , for example , is known as a country where a lot of girls are aborted or killed right after birth , as they are considered to be too expensive for poorer families , who traditionally have to pay a costly dowry on the girl 's wedding day . Interestingly , the global mortality rate among boys is higher than that for girls , which could be due to the fact that more male infants are actually born than female ones . Other theories include a stronger immune system in girls , or more premature births among boys .
