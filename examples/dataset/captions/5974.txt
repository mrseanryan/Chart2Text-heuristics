Forecasts up until the year 2018 show that poultry meat consumption across the European Union is expected to increase to 11.86 million metric tons . In the following decade consumption will likely slow down , with the forecast up until 2028 remaining constant . By the end of the period in consideration , consumption will amount to an estimated 12.18 million metric tons . Poultry production in Europe The European Union is the third biggest broiler meat producer in the world , producing 12.5 million metric tons in 2019 . Broiler meat refers to chickens that are bred for the sole purpose of meat production . In 2017 the United Kingdom and Turkey were the largest poultry producing countries throughout Europe , with 1.24 and 1.23 billion poultry slaughtered respectively . Reduction in meat consumption With the consumption of poultry set to slow down in the future , it is no surprise to see that 27 percent of Europeans are planning to eat less meat in the coming years , with five percent planning to eat no meat all . The biggest reason for this is the perceived negative health effects of meat consumption , followed by animal welfare concerns .
