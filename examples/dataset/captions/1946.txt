The number one most expensive drug , as of 2018 , was Glybera or alipogene tiparvovec with a list price of around 1.2 million U.S. dollars per year . Ravicti was ranked the second expensive drug , used in the long-term treatment of urea cycle disorders . Ravicti is marketed by Horizon Pharma , a former U.S.-based but now Irish-based pharmaceutical company . The most costly drugs worldwide based on wholesale acquisition cost ( list price ) are mostly orphan drugs for rare diseases . What are orphan drugs ? Orphan drugs are pharmaceutical products for the treatment of so-called rare diseases . These are diseases with a very low prevalence within a population . Thus , it is not too appealing for companies to invest into R & D for drugs , which they potentially could sell only to a small number of patients . However , because persons afflicted by rare diseases should have the same right for care and treatment as persons with more common diseases , specific regulations were introduced over time . In 1983 , the Orphan Drug Act was signed in the United States , for example . The impact of the Orphan Drug Act The Orphan Drug Act applies certain incentives for pharmaceutical companies to develop and market orphan drugs . This includes , for example , tax credits on clinical research , accelerated administrative procedures , and a 7-year market exclusivity after approval . These and other benefits significantly changed the level of interest in rare disease treatments . Given the fact that there are around 7,000 rare and ultra-rare diseases , drug manufacturers are increasingly entering this market with large potential . It becomes especially profitable when an already existing drug for common diseases also shows effects on a rare disease , or when an orphan drug emerges to be effective for other , more common diseases . In such cases , the orphan status of the drug helps companies to extend market exclusivity and add higher price tags , causing some critics to claim that the industry is gaming the system .
