The common equity tier 1 capital ratio of HSBC was to 14.7 percent in 2019 . This was up from 14 percent the year earlier , the highest ratio in the past six years . What is the tier 1 capital ratio ? Tier 1 capital is essentially the amount of money a bank has on hand in case it needs to cover unexpected expenses from risky transactions . Core capital is mostly the combination of retained earnings and common stock . This statistic reports the value of this common stock against risk divided by the risk-weighted total of HSBC 's assets . This is important because losses in these assets or a sudden uptick in withdrawals can easily be covered by tier 1 capital , making this a measure of a bank 's robustness . Importance of core capital Banks keep core capital to guard against unexpected expenses . In the very short run , commercial banks can also borrow from the central bank 's discount window for a low interest rate . In the United States , this is the federal funds rate . Without such reserves and financing options , a run on deposits or a large default on assets can lead to insolvencies .
