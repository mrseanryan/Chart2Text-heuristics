This statistic displays the excise tax in euros per hectolitre of beer added to beer in selected European countries as of July 2017 . Finland had the highest rate of excise tax valued at 153.84 euros per hectolitre of beer , followed by Ireland with excise tax valued at 108.24 euros . Excise tax rates vary across the European Union and often serve political , as well as financial ends , such as for environmental protection or public safety and health . Some countries impose further taxes at differing levels , as seen in Value Added Tax ( VAT ) , resulting in highly variable retail prices of beer across European supermarkets . Consumption levels of beer , however , also vary between countries , as well as levels of imports . The United Kingdom , for instance , has not only one of the highest excise duty rates on beer , but in addition imports the most beer of all European countries .
