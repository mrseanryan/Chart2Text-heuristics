Life insurance - additional information Life insurance is an important component of basic financial planning and acts as a form of protection against the loss of income resulting from the death of an insured individual . The person named as the beneficiary of the deceased receives the proceeds and is therefore protected against any financial impact that may result from the death . There are different forms of life insurance offered by life insurance companies . Some life insurance policies provide coverage at fixed payments for a length of time that it defined when the policy is initially taken out . After expiration of the fixed period , the previous rate of premiums can be no longer guaranteed to the insured and they are required to either forgo their coverage or accept different terms or conditions . This form of insurance is known as term insurance . Permanent or whole life insurance , on the other hand , is a form which provides the insured with life-long coverage . Term insurance is cheaper than whole life insurance as it is not designed to pay out in all cases . Many people decide to take out fixed-term policies due to their low cost nature .
