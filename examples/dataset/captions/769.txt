In 2011 , 39 percent of the total population in Canada were Catholic , a fifth of the population identifies as Protestant , but almost a quarter are not religious at all â€“ with the rest stating they adhere to Islam , Buddhism , the Jewish or the Sikh faith , and other Christian denominations . Canada 's religious pluralism Canada is not a very religious country in general . Canadians adhere to a wide variety of beliefs and faiths , with the majority following Christianity , followed by those who do not believe in any deity or religion at all . As with many Western countries , the younger generations are less inclined to identify with faith , and Christianity in particular is not as popular as it is among the older generations . Alternative worship for the younger generations ? Canadian teenagers are no less enthusiastic about religion than their parents , and they are just as grounded in their faith as the older generations . They are , however , also just as indecisive when it comes to whether they would call themselves religious or not . Interestingly , they seem much more interested in traditional aboriginal spirituality than in the Judeo-Christian model . They also seem quite interested in another alternative to Christianity : Buddhism is quite popular among the younger generations . Whether this signifies a general trend away from Christianity and towards religious alternatives remains to be seen .
