This statistic shows the total population of Spain from 2010 to 2018 , with projections up until 2024 . In 2018 , the total population of Spain was around 46.45 million people . Population of Spain While Spain 's fertility rate has been relatively steady over the past decade , its year-over-year population growth has been declining continuously at the same time . A very noticeable plunge was observed from 2008 to 2009 , when population growth was almost halved . Reasons for this decline are manifold , it is speculated that is was caused by the economic crisis taking place simultaneously . The collapse of the job and real estate markets may have led the Spanish to postpone having ( more ) kids or to migrate to other countries in search of a more stable economy . This theory is supported by data on the average age of Spain 's inhabitants ; a look at the median age of Spain 's population from 1950 up until today shows that the Spanish get older on average â€“ perhaps due to the aforementioned factors . Speaking of Spain 's economy , economic key factors suggest that the country is still recovering from the crisis . Its gross domestic product ( GDP ) was in admirable shape prior to the collapse , but it still has not returned to its former glory . Only recently has Spain reported actual GDP growth since 2008 , it remains to be seen if this is going to translate into a positive trend over the next few years . This in turn could mean that the country 's unemployment rate is slowly but surely decreasing again after peaking at an alarming 25 percent in 2013 .
