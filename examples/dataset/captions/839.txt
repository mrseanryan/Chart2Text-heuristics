Employment and economy in the United States The most notable surge in unemployment in the United States occurred between 2008 and 2009 , and peaked in 2010 . The United States was one of the countries most severely affected by the global financial crisis , primarily due to the crash originally materializing in the country . The crisis had a considerable effect on American households , most prominently on the labor market , which was also met with a significant decline in the stock market as well as the housing market . In order to stabilize and maintain a healthy economy , the United States government was inclined to absorb debt . The country 's national debt had increased yearly , however surged most remarkably in 2009 and has almost doubled in roughly 6 years since the crash . In order to determine if a country is able to pay back debt , the so-called debt-to-GDP ratio is used . It is often expressed as a percentage - the lower the percentage , the more likely a country can pay back debts without absorbing further debt . The United States ' debt-to-GDP ratio correspondingly began increasing in 2008 , after experiencing an annual decline in the years prior , and is continuing to increase . Additionally , the United States maintained a budget deficit over the past decade , implying that its expenditures are higher than its revenues . This value has however significantly declined since 2009 .
