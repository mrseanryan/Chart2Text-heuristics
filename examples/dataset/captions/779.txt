In 2018 , the inflation rate in Ghana amounted to about 9.84 percent compared to the previous year . Ghana 's inflation peaked at almost 17.5 percent in 2016 and is predicted to decrease to 8 percent by 2024 . Steady is best for inflation According to economists , a steady inflation rate between two and three percent is desirable to achieve a stable economy in a country . Inflation is the increase in the price level of consumer goods and services over a certain time period . A high inflation rate is often caused by excessive money supply and can turn into hyperinflation , i.e . if inflation occurs too quickly and rapidly , it can devalue currency and cause a recession and even economic collapse . This scenario is currently taking place in Venezuela , for example . The opposite of inflation , the decrease in the price level of goods and services below zero percent , is called deflation . While hyperinflation devalues money , deflation usually increases its value . Both events can damage an economy severely . Is Ghana 's economy at risk ? Ghana 's economy is considered quite stable and fast-growing , and is rich in oil , diamonds , and gold . After struggling in the years around 2015 due to increased government spending and plummeting oil prices , it is now on an upswing again . This is also reflected in the decreasing inflation rate , and other key indicators like unemployment and rapid GDP growth support this theory . However , Ghana 's government debt is still struggling with the consequences of the 2015 crisis and forecast to keep skyrocketing during the next few years .
