In the fiscal year of 2018 , China was the largest sales market for BMW . China accounted for almost 26 percent of Rolls-Royce , BMW , and MINI sales . Chinese customers bought about 640,800 such vehicles in the 2018 fiscal year . This is more than twice as many vehicles as were snapped up by motorists in Germany . U.S. consumers are losing interest in MINI Between the 2014 and 2018 fiscal years , BMW sales in the United States fell from almost 400,000 to about 356,000 units . While BMW 's small MINI hatchbacks were never going to take the U.S. market by storm , nobody at BMW will have foreseen the low and disappointing sales figures of May 2019 : MINI sales dropped 33.2 percent in May 2019 over May 2018 . The luxury car maker 's revenue , too , is indicative of tepid year-on-year growth in the United States , as well as negative growth in the European market . However , it should be noted that BMW 's overall year-end sales figures in the United States increased in 2018 over 2019 . Additionally , BMW-branded vehicle sales in the U.S. had risen for the 14th month straight in December 2018 .
