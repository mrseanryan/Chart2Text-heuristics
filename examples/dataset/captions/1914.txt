Live attendance During the 39 UFC events in 2018 , a total of 474 fights took place , a number that 's held held rather steady since 2014 . The highest live attendance was seen at UFC 193 on November 14th 2015 , featuring Ronda Rousey versus Holly Holm , with a total of 56,214 attendees . UFC 129 , Georges St-Pierre versus Jake Shields almost had as many live spectators with 55,724 at the octagon . Fighter earnings The highest all-time earnings directly through UFC fights were those of Conor McGregor at roughly 12 million U.S. dollars , however the majority of his personal income comes from other sources such as bonuses , endorsement deals , or for example his professional boxing match against Floyd Mayweather , for which he received over 75 million U.S. dollars . The earnings of fights depend heavily on the style card they fight . For example in UFC 227 Demetrious Johnson , who was fighting in main card , had the highest earning for that event with 470 thousand U.S. dollars .
