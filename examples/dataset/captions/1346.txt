In 2019 , the music album with the most unit sales in the United States was 'Lover ' by Taylor Swift , far outperforming all other records in the list with almost 1.1 million copies sold that year . Second was 'When We All Fall Asleep , Where Do We Go ? ' by Billie Eilish with 594.6 thousand sales , followed by 'Happiness Begins ' by the Jonas Brothers . Other artists with best-selling albums in 2018 The ranking also includes albums by artists who proved extremely popular in 2019 such as Ariana Grande , Khalid , and Post Malone . The three artists also featured in the list of top-selling music albums based on total streams . Other well-known artists like Harry Styles , BTS , and the the Backstreet Boys made the top ten , selling between 300 and more than 450 thousand albums each in 2019 . Again though , among music fans the presence of these names on the ranking will be unremarkable and , frankly , expected . A name which may come as a surprise is Tool , whose album â€˜ Fear Inoculum ' sold over 344 thousand copies . The album marked the rock band 's first release since 2006 , and received widespread critical acclaim upon its release and performed well in the charts in its opening week . Songs 'Fear Inoculum ' and ' 7empest ' were both nominated for Grammys in 2019 , the latter of which had a runtime of more than 15 minutes , making it the longest track on the album .
