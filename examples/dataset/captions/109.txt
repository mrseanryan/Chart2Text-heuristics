As of the week ending January 9 , 2020 , Tones and I 's 'Dance Monkey ' was the most-streamed track on Spotify with 50.24 million streams worldwide , followed by ‘ Yummy ' by Justin Bieber with 36.77 million . How do music artists get so many streams on Spotify ? Firstly , Spotify is one of the most successful and popular music streaming services in the United States , and as of the first half of 2018 had the biggest share of music streaming subscribers in the world . With Spotify 's vast audience , featuring on the platform is a good start for emerging and popular artists hoping to make an impact . Secondly , there is no exact science to ‘ going viral ' _ . From the famous egg photo on Instagram posted in early 2019 to wildly successful music video ‘ Gangnam Style ' released back in 2012 , viral content comes in all shapes and sizes . Purposeful viral marketing is one way in which something could go viral , and is one of the reasons why some songs have so many streams in a short space of time . This type of marketing involves a tactical approach and pre-planning in an attempt to push the content into the public eye and encourage it to spread as quickly as possible . However , many artists who go viral do not expect to . Accessible , catchy content created by an already popular artist is already poised to do well , i.e . the latest song or album from U.S. singer Drake . This is an example of incidental viral marketing , when content spreads by itself partially as a result of an established and engaged audience . Indeed , Spotify 's most-streamed tracks generally originate from a well-known figure with a large following . But for smaller or entirely unknown content creators , going viral or experiencing their 15 minutes of fame can simply be a case of posting the right thing at the right time .
