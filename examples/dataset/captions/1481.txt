In 2019 , Ford 's U.S. market share was around 14.1 percent , trailing only General Motors ( GM ) . The two largest U.S. brands are relentless competitors in the global automobile industry . GM and Ford The competition between Ford and General Motors has played out strongly in the case of truck sales , with GM taking the lead in the first quarter of 2019 with a market share of 44 percent . This is partly because one of Ford 's auto parts suppliers , Meridian Magnesium , experienced a devastating factory fire in May 2018 . This stopped production of the Ford F-150 , one of the company 's most popular vehicles and the best-selling light truck in the United States . GM , in contrast , has had success with incentives on its pickup Chevrolet Silverado . A transition away from passenger cars In 2018 , Ford announced that - by 2020 - almost 90 percent of its North American model selection will consist of trucks and commercial vehicles . This clear shift away from the car business was probably spurred by the fact that Ford 's sales of crossovers and sports utility vehicles ( SUVs ) increased by over six percent in 2018 .
