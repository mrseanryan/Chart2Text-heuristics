Within the U.S. criminal justice system , criminal cases can be cleared ( or closed ) one of two ways . The first is through arrest , which means that at least one person has either been arrested , charged with an offense , or turned over to the court for prosecution . The second way a case can be closed is through what is called exceptional means , where law enforcement must have either identified the offender , gathered enough evidence to arrest , charge , and prosecute someone , identified the offender 's exact location , or come up against a circumstance outside the control of law enforcement that keeps them from arresting and prosecuting the offender . Crime in the United States Despite what many people may believe , crime in the United States has been on the decline . Particularly in regard to violent crime , the violent crime rate has almost halved since 1990 , meaning that the U.S. is safer than it was almost 30 years ago .
