The Jacksonville Jaguars had the highest average annual player salary in the 2018/19 season – each of their players took home an average of 3.34 million U.S. dollars . The Jaguars proved to be a cautionary tale about how money ca n't buy you success – the franchise finished the season bottom of the AFC South with a record of 5 - 11 . In comparison , the team with the lowest wage bill , the Seattle Seahawks , were able to make it out of their division only to narrowly miss out in the Wild Card Playoffs . The New England Patriots , who have dominated the NFL in recent years , had a surprisingly average wage bill coming in at an average of 2.97 million U.S. dollars per player , 14th on the list . New England Patriots Despite the franchise 's modest wage bill , the Patriots ' success in recent years is anything but modest . The team took home the Vince Lombardi Trophy in 2019 , having beaten the Los Angeles Rams 13 - 3 in the Super Bowl . This marked the Patriots ' third success in five years and their sixth Super Bowl victory overall . Their latest title drew them level with the Pittsburgh Steelers with six total Super Bowl wins . However , with the Steelers ' last title coming back in 2009 , it seems only a matter of time before the Patriots claim the outright lead . No doubt helped by the team 's recent success , the franchise value of the New England Patriots has soared from 1.8 billion U.S. dollars in 2013 to 3.8 billion U.S. dollars in 2018 . The franchise 's revenue has also increased in recent years , with the latest estimates reaching almost 600 million U.S. dollars . High and lows of NFL salaries In order to ensure that the athletes are fairly compensated for their work , the NFL has a minimum annual player salary in place . This wage stood at 375 thousand U.S. dollars in 2011 , but has since risen to almost 500 thousand U.S. dollars in 2019 . At the other end of the spectrum , a hard salary cap is also in place to ensure teams do not overspend on players . This cap was at 188.2 million U.S. dollars in 2019 and breaches of this cap include fines of up to five million U.S. dollars , loss of draft picks , or cancellation of contracts .
