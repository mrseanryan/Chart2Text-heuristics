While the Dallas Cowboys may have last tasted Super Bowl success back in 1996 , the Texas outfit is still by far the most valuable franchise in the National Football League . Latest estimates value the franchise at 5.5 billion U.S. dollars , some 1.4 billion U.S. dollars more than its nearest rival , the New England Patriots . Cowboys lead the way off the pitch ... In 2019 , the Cowboys ' franchise was valued at 5.5 billion U.S. dollars , whilst the average franchise value in the NFL stood at about 2.86 billion U.S. dollars . That same year , the Cowboys generated 950 million U.S. dollars in revenue , the most of all NFL teams . The franchise also ranks top in the list of most valuable sports team brands worldwide , just ahead of other household names such as the New York Yankees and Real Madrid . Along with the San Francisco 49ers , the Dallas Cowboys have been crowned Super Bowl champions a total of five times . The Cowboys ' Golden Era came in the 1990s , when the team claimed three Super Bowl Rings between 1993 and 1996 . ... while the Patriots dominate on the pitch The Boston-based New England Patriots are the second most valuable franchise in the league , valued at 4.1 billion U.S. dollars in 2019 . The team , who plays its home games at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough , Massachusetts , is also amongst the highest grossing teams in the league , as the Pats ' revenue amounted to 600 million U.S. dollars in 2019 . The Patriots have dominated the Super Bowl in recent years , with all six of their titles coming under head coach , Bill Belichick , since 2002 . The team is led by legendary quarterback , Tom Brady , who holds the record for most career playoff wins - his 30 career playoff wins are almost double that of his closest rival on the list , Joe Montana . It is unsurprising , then , that the Patriots quarterback also features fourth on the list of players with the most passing yards in NFL history . Indeed , he is only one of four players in NFL history with more than 70 thousand passing yards , the other three being Brett Favre , Peyton Manning , and Drew Brees , who sits at the very top of the pile .
