The total contribution of travel and tourism to South Korea 's GDP amounted to around 81 trillion South Korean won in 2017 . This number includes direct , indirect , as well as induced contributions . The value decreased in 2017 due to the decrease in visitor arrivals that year . Importance of tourists from Mainland China After a peak in 2016 , the number of visitors from Mainland China to South Korea plunged the following year , due to political tension between the two countries . The tensions led to Beijing ordering travel companies to stop selling group tours to South Korea . Since Chinese tourists made up for almost half of all visitor arrivals to South Korea , this had a notable impact on the otherwise steadily growing tourism industry . The number of visitors from Mainland China started to grow again in 2018 . Hallyu boosts the industry Hallyu , also known as the `` Korean wave '' is a common term referring to the South Korean popular culture , including music , TV shows , and movies . With South Korean popular culture gaining popularity around the globe , the number of visitors to the countries grows as well . For example , after the TV drama Winter Sonata gained popularity overseas in 2002 , the number of foreign visitors to its rural filming location Nami Island started to grow . The drama is widely considered to be the start of Hallyu throughout worldwide . Another example is the Korean pop boy band BTS , which is currently considered as the biggest boy band in the world . In 2018 , the Seoul Metropolitan Government gave credit to the band for boosting the tourism industry .
