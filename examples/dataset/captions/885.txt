It is projected that the residential electricity price in the United States will increase by 3.6 percent between 2018 and 2019 . Generally , retail electricity prices in the country have risen over the last decade . This trend is likely to continue as natural gas prices will likely also increase , raising electricity rates . As the natural gas supply is exposed to international markets that pay a higher rate , U.S. prices are also expected to rise despite a decrease in recent years that came as a result of the hydraulic fracturing boom . States with the highest and lowest electricity prices The price of electricity is partially dependent on the various energy sources , such as coal , gas , oil , as well as renewable or nuclear sources , used to generate power . Hawaii has one of the highest electricity prices at 32.46 U.S. dollars per kilowatt hour due to the high costs of crude oil used to fuel the state 's electricity . In comparison , Idaho has one of the lowest retail rates , as much of the state 's energy is generated from hydroelectricity which requires virtually no fuel and construction costs can be spread out over decades . Bills can vary greatly depending on both state and region . Demand for electricity is also expected to increase , especially in regions that will likely require more heating and cooling as climate change impacts progress , driving up electricity prices .
