In 2018 , the purchasing power in the Netherlands increased for the fourth year in a row . Purchasing power growth slowed down considerably though in 2017 and 2018 in comparison to 2015 and especially 2016 . In the next two years , the purchasing power was forecast to increase further . A second forecast predicts that a large number of Dutch households will experience an increase in purchasing power . Just over 22,000 households were forecast to see a growth of five percent or more . Singles with average income see purchasing power grow the most The singles with average incomes ( 35,000 euros ) were expected to see the most significant increase in their purchasing power in 2019 , at over two percent . With the exception of couples with one child on a double income ( earning between 10,000 and 25,000 euros ) though , all other household types could foresee a growth in purchasing power . Purchasing power under Rutte III-government Pensioners and people on social security benefits are especially vulnerable to the dynamics of a changing economic situation . Another forecast released just before the Rutte III government was inaugurated in October 2017 predicts a growth of the purchasing power for all groups under the new government : the working , the pensioners and the recipients of benefits . It was however expected that the purchasing power of the employed group would increase far more than the purchasing power of pensioners and people on social security : 1.4 percent vs. 0.6 and 0.7 percent .
