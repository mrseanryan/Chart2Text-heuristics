Gross domestic product of Japan Japan has one of the highest gross domestic products ( GDP ) per capita , one of the lowest inflation rates , and ranks among the top three countries in terms of the largest overall GDP . This economic powerhouse has managed to maintain control of its inflation rate , keeping it below three percent since at least 2004 . Despite the worldwide recession in 2008 and 2009 and a dip in the growth rate of the GDP , Japan managed to maintain positive growth in the GDP itself . Japan is disadvantaged , however , when it comes to natural resources . A large amount of the landmass of Japan is human-occupied , leaving little in terms of husbandry or agriculture . It has become a highly urbanized country and employs very little of its workforce in agriculture , choosing instead to focus on its services sector . The population of Japan is aging , providing a rocky economic forecast for years ahead . As the baby boomer generation starts to retire , they will leave more job openings than there will be workers to fill them . The government will have to work to provide retirement pensions for a growing amount of people , although if current trends persevere , there will be fewer people left paying taxes to fund the pensions .
