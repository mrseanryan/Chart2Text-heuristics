In South Korea in 2017 , there were approximately 2.34 doctors for every 1,000 Koreans . This was a slight increase compared to the preceding year , and this ratio has increased steadily since 2000 , exception for a slight drop in 2004 . However , Korea still has few doctors relative to its population . The OECD average was 3.3 doctors per 1,000 people , and among the full OECD member countries , only Turkey had a lower ratio of 1.9 . According to OECD data , only Turkey and the accession candidate Colombia and the key partners , the People 's Republic of China , South Africa , and India have ratios lower than Korea 's . At the other end of the spectrum is Austria with 5.2 doctors per 1,000 people , followed by Norway with 4.8 and Lithuania with 4.6 . Shortage of medical staffs The Korean government officially declared a shortage of several thousand doctors across the nation and recommended the training of an additional 150 doctors every year to make up the shortfall . Furthermore , doctors of traditional Korean medicine are counted among the number of doctors , meaning there are even fewer doctors of modern medical sciences than the official figures suggest . Yet several factors , such as resistance from doctors , prevent the government from simply increasing the number of medical graduates . Regional imbalances in the medical environment Some experts refute the government 's claims that Korea faces a doctor shortage and point towards other factors . For example , Korea has a higher population density than other countries , meaning that the average Korean doctor meets with more patients than an Austrian or Norwegian would , for example . Indeed , half the population is concentrated in the Seoul Capital Area and Koreans see doctors over 20 times a year on average , which is far more frequently than any other OECD nationals . Despite this , Korea spends a lower share of its GDP on medical expenditures than other OECD countries , implying that medical personnel do more work for less financial compensation . Regional disparities where doctors are concentrated in Seoul and other major cities is also an issue . The doctor-to-people ratio in Seoul is higher than the national ratio and the same as the OECD average . Many argue that a shortage of nurses , not because too few are being trained but because many leave because of harsh working conditions , is a greater concern than an alleged shortage of doctors .
