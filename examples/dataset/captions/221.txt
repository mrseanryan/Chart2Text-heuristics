Population of the United Kingdom Despite a fertility rate just below the replacement rate , the United Kingdom 's population has been slowly but steadily growing , increasing by an average of 0.6 percent every year since 2002 . The age distribution has remained roughly the same for the past ten years or so , with the share of the population over 65 years old seeing a slight increase as the baby boomer generation enters into that age bracket . That share is likely to continue growing slightly , as the United Kingdom has one of the highest life expectancies in the world . The population of the island nation is predominantly whiteChristians , but a steady net influx of immigrants , part of a legacy of the wide-reaching former British Empire , has helped diversify the population . One of the largest ethnic minorities in the United Kingdom is that of residents of an Indian background , born either in the UK , India , or in other parts of the world . India itself is experiencing problems with rapid population growth , causing some of its population to leave the country in order to find employment . The United Kingdom 's relatively lower levels of unemployment and the historical connection between the two countries ( which has also resulted in family connections between individuals ) are likely reasons that make it a popular destination for Indian emigrants .
