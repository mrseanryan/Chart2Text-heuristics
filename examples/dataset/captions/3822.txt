The federal funds rate is the rate at which financial institutions can borrow overnight from other depository institutions . These overnight loans are vital for banks because they ensure that the bank has constant access to cash , guaranteeing liquidity in the financial system . However , a higher rate means banks prefer to hold their money , slowing the loans issued and causes a decrease in the money supply . While this slows the economy , it also reduces inflation . Historic perspective The history of the federal funds rate shows ups and downs that follow the business cycle . When there is a recession , the rate drops , slowly increasing after the economy recovers . In addition to aggressive asset purchase programs , some central banks , including the European Central Bank , introduced negative interest rates . It remains to be seen how the Federal Reserve and other central banks will react to the next crisis .
