In the last decade , the average age of the Dutch population increased year on year . Whereas the population had an average age of nearly 40 years in 2009 , ten years later the average age reached 42 years . As a result , in this period the grey population pressure ( the ratio of the non-working population compared to the working population ) increased as well , by over eight percentage points . Historical development Since the 1950s , the average age of the population has increased significantly . In nearly 70 years , the population 's average age grew by over ten years . This also caused a more than doubling of the grey population pressure in the country in this period , from 14 percent in 1950 to 32.6 percent in 2019 . By 2060 , the grey population pressure in the Netherlands is forecast to reach nearly 50 percent , meaning that for every working person in the country , there will also be a non-working person . Comparison to Belgium The average age of the population in the Netherlands was comparable to the average age of the population in neighboring country Belgium , which reached 41.6 years in 2018 . In Belgium too , the average age of the population is expected to increase in the future . By 2020 , the average age here is forecast to reach nearly 41.9 years .
