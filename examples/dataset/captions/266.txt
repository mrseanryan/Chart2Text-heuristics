As of the third quarter of 2019 , The British Broadcasting Corporation ( BBC ) made up four of the top five radio stations in the United Kingdom for weekly reach . BBC Radio 2 , the leading radio station in the UK saw its average consumer listen to over ten hours per week . The UK radio industry has seen revenues remain stagnant between 2014 and 2018 . Podcasts and listen again radio One issue that traditional radio has had to face is the rise of podcasts and listen again radio stations as well as music streaming services . Consumers can now listen to exactly what they want , when they want , often without having to listen to advertising breaks . In 2018 , approximately seven million people listened to podcasts in the UK . Also in 2018 , approximately 30 percent of individuals used Spotify in the UK . Demographics In 2017 , those aged between 25 and 44 were most likely to have listened to radio in the previous week . Unlike some other forms of media , UK consumers have been relatively slow to move over to online and app-based consumption . This may be due to the popularity of radio during drive time commutes . The AM/FM radio was still the most popular form of radio consumption in the UK in 2018 .
