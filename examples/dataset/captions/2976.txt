The term ‘ fake news ' is used in multiple different contexts , but officially refers simply to false information presented as legitimate news . Adults in the United States believe social media platforms and online news sites to be the most likely sources of fake news – 58 percent of respondents to a survey believed that Facebook was the most likely place in which they would encounter false news stories , and 49 percent said the same about Twitter . A separate study revealed that 66 percent of U.S. adults believed that 76 percent or more of the news they saw on social media was biased . Social networks are generally not seen as credible or trustworthy news platforms – on a global level , social media was the least trusted source of general news and information . Why does social media fuel or help to spread fake news ? Sadly , the main way in which fake news can be so quickly disseminated throughout not only one , but multiple social media platforms , is by users sharing such news with others ( either knowingly or unknowingly ) . The ability to share content with friends and family is one of the key appeals of social networks , but the ease of doing so becomes somewhat sinister when it comes to the spread of false information . Ten percent of U.S. adults admitted to knowingly sharing fake news or information online , 49 percent said that they shared such content and later found out it was inaccurate or made up , and 52 percent admitted to having done either of these things . This is a serious cause for concern . Sharing news in good faith and later discovering it was fake is one thing , but deliberately and knowingly passing such content on to others is another . Many social media users blame the networks themselves for the spread of fake news . Whilst social platforms do make attempts to regulate the content shared on their sites , the more users who actively take responsibility for the content they choose to share and hold themselves accountable , the greater the overall impact .
