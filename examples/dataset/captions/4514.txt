This statistic shows gross domestic product ( GDP ) of the European Union from 2014 to 2024 in billion U.S. dollars . In 2018 , the EU 's GDP amounted to about 18.74 trillion U.S. dollars . Brexit and the economy of the European Union The European Union is still recovering from the crisis in 2008 , but it is by no means making an impressive comeback and 2016 has not started out on the right foot either . Total GDP of the European Union staggered in 2012 and even moreso in 2015 . Recent events are also bound to reduce consumer confidence and drag down growth . The year began with the economic slowdown in China and has continued on with the United Kingdom 's decision to leave the European Union . The long term effects this decision is expected to have have an overall negative effect on GDP growth within the European Union . However , the effects will likely hit the UK and Ireland more so . By 2030 , it is expected that the GDP growth of the European Union will be negative at around minus 0.36 percent . Even considering an optimistic scenario , GDP of the UK is expected to decrease by 2.72 percent by 2030 , as well - a pessimistic forecast even reducing GDP growth to a 7.7 percent decrease . Yet , it is still too early to tell how Brexit will play out in reality , but it will almost certainly impact current future projections of GDP growth in the European Union and the Euro Area .
