A country 's real GDP is a measure that shows the value of the goods and services produced by an economy and is adjusted for inflation . The real GDP of a country helps economists to see the health of a country 's economy and its standard of living . Downturns in GDP growth can indicate financial difficulties , such as the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 , when the U.S. GDP decreased by 2.5 percent . Why real GDP per capita matters Real GDP per capita takes the GDP of a country , state , or metropolitan area and divides it by the number of people in that area . Some argue that per-capita GDP is more important than the GDP of a country , as it is a good indicator of whether or not the country 's population is getting wealthier , thus increasing the standard of living in that area .
