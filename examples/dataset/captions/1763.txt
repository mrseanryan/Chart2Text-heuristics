Asylum seekers and minors among the migrants In September 2019 , the largest number of asylum applicants in Italy were from Pakistan . For instance , 779 requests were recorded only in that month . In addition , 218 applicants were from Nigeria , the second most common nationality among the asylum seekers . In the last years , many unaccompanied minors reached the Italian coasts . Between January and October 2019 , over a thousand children migrated without their parents into the country . Contrasting opinions and distorted perceptions According to the data published by Ipsos , a part of Italians tend to overestimate the size of the immigrated population . The results of this survey uncovered the presence of distorted perceptions in 2018 : people thought that about 28 percent of the Italian population was not born in Italy , whereas the actual percentage was around ten . Furthermore , the public opinion on migration was controversial . In the same year , roughly half of the population perceived migrants as a risk for the Italian economy . On the other hand , 18 percent of Italians believed that migration could be a resource for the country .
