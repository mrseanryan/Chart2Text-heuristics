In 2019 , over 65 thousand Volvo cars were sold in Sweden . This was a decrease of more than four thousand vehicles when compared to the previous year , and the second time since 2012 that the company did not experience a rise in sales . Nevertheless , Volvo was actually the leading passenger car brand in Sweden that year , surpassing Volkswagen by more than 16 thousand sold passenger cars . A national and global success In Latin , Volvo means `` I am rolling '' - a word which perfectly describes the success of the company . Since the foundation of Volvo in Gothenburg in 1927 , the company has continuously expanded its production to a range of different countries and continents , including Europe , China and the US . As of February 2019 , Volvo AB and Volvo Car accounted for the highest turnovers of companies in Sweden , amounting to more than 500 million Swedish kronor altogether . Furthermore , Volvo is the fourth biggest employer in Sweden , employing roughly 100,000 persons . Conquering China As a consequence of the automotive industrial crisis from 2008 to 2019 , Volvo Cars was sold to the Chinese Holding Group , Geely , in 2009 . This was the first time in history that a Western car manufacture was owned by a Chinese company . So which changes might this takeover have for Volvo ? While the revenue of Volvo passenger cars amounted to one billion U.S. dollars in China in 2014 , sales are expected to exceed 11 billion U.S. dollars as of 2023 . That is an impressive increase , since Volvo cars cost 99 percent more than an average car in China .
