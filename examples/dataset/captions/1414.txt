The statistic shows the ten countries with the ten largest populations in mid 2018 . In mid 2018 , approximately 1.39 billion people lived in China . The largest countries and the global population The total world population amounts to more than 7 billion people , with China reporting the highest number of inhabitants – its total population surpassed the 1.3 billion mark a few years ago and continues to rise . Due to improved living conditions and better health care , the global population continues to increase ; mortality rates are decreasing and the median age of the world population has been increasing for the past few years , because people lead healthier lives with access to healthcare and clean water . As for the average life expectancy in industrial and developing countries , the gap is also quite narrow nowadays . Asia is the most populous continent on Earth ; several of the largest countries are located there . It leads the ranking of the global population by continent by far , reporting four times as many inhabitants as Africa . Interestingly , the Americas are behind both Africa and Europe on this ranking , with Oceania reporting the lowest numbers of inhabitants . There have been a number of methods suggested with the aim of preventing overpopulation on a global scale ranging from realizable solutions to fantastic theories . One far-fetched solution stretches even to setting up colonies on other planets . It may be some time before this ‘ solution ' migrates from the realms of science fiction into science fact , but it highlights the seriousness of the dilemma with which national governments are faced : Population growth is a serious problem , and it can have severe consequences for a country . A fast-growing population rate can cause environmental problems , overpopulation and , subsequently , deteriorating living conditions . Extraterrestrial colonization aside , some countries have already initiated more realistic solutions to counteract overpopulation . Again , China is a prominent example : The Chinese government proclaimed its so-called `` one-child policy '' as a form of population control , making it illegal for a Chinese family to have more than one child . However successful it might be claimed to have been , this policy is a controversial solution and continues to have a lot of negative effects for the Chinese population .
