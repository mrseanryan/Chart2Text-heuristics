Manchester United are currently the record title winners in the English top flight having won the division a total of 20 times since 1889 . They have also won the world 's oldest domestic soccer competition , the FA Cup , 12 times , most recently in 2016 . This figure is surpassed only by Arsenal FC , who have lifted the cup 13 times . The London team pulled ahead of Manchester United after claiming their 13th title with a 2 - 1 victory against Chelsea in the 2016 - 17 season . Still Premier League giants ? The majority of Manchester United 's championship wins came since the inception of the Premier League at the beginning of the 1992/93 season under the leadership of manager Sir Alex Ferguson . Indeed , United 's most recent title came in the 2012 - 13 season , which was Ferguson 's final season of management before his retirement . This title drought will have been compounded by the fact that city rivals , Manchester City , claimed the Premier League trophy in 2018 and 2019 . More than a football club Manchester United is undoubtedly one of the biggest football clubs in the world . While success on the pitch has been lacking in recent years , the value of the brand off the pitch continues to grow . The club generates considerable revenue from matchday activities and broadcasting ; however , the largest revenue is generated in its commercial segment . This is unsurprising considering the club not only has a huge following in the United Kingdom but also across the world , most notably in Asia . The club generates millions of U.S. dollars in sponsorship and merchandising as fans want to show support for their team wherever they are in the world . The global nature of the club can be seen by the fact that the official Facebook page has over 73 million fans , considerably larger than the population of the whole of the United Kingdom .
