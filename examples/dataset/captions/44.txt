The selection of fuels used to generate electricity remains a main driver behind Italy 's high electricity prices . There are no nuclear power plants in the country . Due to the fact that Italy is located in a seismically active area , all nuclear power plants were closed following a popular referendum in the late 1980s , when an explosion in Chernobyl reminded Europeans of the dangers of nuclear power . As a result , the country 's electricity generation mix consists mainly of natural gas , renewable energy , petroleum products and coal . Although Italy has one of the largest proved natural gas reserves in Europe , the Mediterranean country produces very little natural gas and is heavily dependent on imports . The main source countries for Italian natural gas imports include Algeria , Russia and Libya . In light of political instability in the said countries , Italy might turn to producing more electricity from renewable energy sources , including hydropower , geothermal power and solar electricity . In 2017 , Italy 's cumulative solar photovoltaic capacity reached 19.7 gigawatts , making it the fifth largest market for solar PV power .
