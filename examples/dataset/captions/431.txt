This statistic shows the total population of Brazil from 2014 to 2018 , with a forecast through 2024 . In 2019 , the total population of Brazil was estimated at almost 210 million inhabitants . Population of Brazil Brazil has a surprisingly low ( and decreasing ) population growth rate ; despite it being home to the largest number of Catholics in the world , the majority of women in Brazil use some form of contraception , which is often government-subsidized or free , even though the Catholic Church retains its stance that the use of contraceptives is inherently wrong . Within the space of just one generation , families have gone from having more than six children to having just one or two , and the share of Catholics in the population is dwindling , too . The influence of 'telenovelas ' — the overwhelmingly popular soap operas often with strong women figures and fewer than three children — could also be helping shape the population 's view of what an ideal family is . The fertility rate in Brazil fell below the replacement rate in 2006 and is still decreasing . The impending population imbalance in Brazil can be seen in the decreasing lower tier of the country 's age distribution . This follows a trend similar to the one Japan and many European countries are experiencing , which are now facing the problems of providing for an aging population with fewer young and working taxpayers . The trend is not quite as extreme in Brazil , giving it time to prepare for the fallout of decreasing family size . This preparation will be important to help the country maintain its emerging economic strength , which is watched with interest by many economists who have said that Brazil 's is one to watch — thus its position as one of the pillars of the `` big four '' BRIC countries .
