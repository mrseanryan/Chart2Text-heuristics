In 2019 , the unemployment rate in Jamaica was at approximately 9.52 percent , a slight decrease from previous years . Jamaica 's economy is in good shape Although on a steady downward trend after peaking at over 15 percent in 2013 , Jamaica 's unemployment rate is still quite high but not alarmingly high in global comparison . More than half of the island 's population live in urban areas and cities already , and the numbers are rising . Most working Jamaicans are employed in the services sector , mainly tourism , but agriculture has been slightly growing as well – no surprise , since Jamaica is not only rich in resources but also cultivates and exports sugar , coconuts , bananas , cocoa , and citrus fruits , among other commodities . The hottest vacation destination Travel and tourism provide a large share of Jamaica 's gross domestic product ( GDP ) . The island is one of the most popular tourist destinations for Americans , for example , and reported more than 2.3 million overnight tourist arrivals in 2017 alone – a remarkable increase over the last decade and a new record for the country . Many of these tourists visit in December , and in 2017 , a winter vacation in the warm Caribbean has even outranked a stay during the summer months .
