Forecasts suggest that nearly 13.5 million microwave ovens will be shipped in the United States in 2019 , marking the product 's highest sales figure in years . Although quite a mature market , microwave oven shipments have fluctuated significantly over the past few decades . Between 2005 and 2013 total shipments fell from around 13.9 million to 9.2 million per year ; but in recent years the market has recovered to previous levels . Small household appliances The small household appliance industry to which microwave ovens belong generally includes household appliances with some degree of portability . Unlike refrigerators and washing machines , small household appliances tend to be countertop products that can be stored away when unneeded . As of 2017 , the average American spent well over 100 dollars per year on small appliances such as microwaves , toasters , vacuums , and coffee makers . This 2017 average spending figure marked an all-time high . Electrolux , a leading home appliance company based in Stockholm , Sweden , recorded over 800 million dollars in small appliance net sales in 2018 .
