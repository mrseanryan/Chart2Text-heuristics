In American Football terms , receiving yards refers to the number of yards gained by a receiver on a passing play – this not only includes the length of the pass , but also the additional yards that the player was able to run once he was in possession of the ball . Jerry Rice is the only player in NFL history with more than 20,000 receiving yards – the wide receiver racked up 22,895 receiving yards in a career spanning from 1985 to 2004 . Jerry Rice – NFL legend With an unrivalled number of receiving yards to his name , it is no wonder that Jerry Rice is considered a legend of the game . Widely lauded as the best wide receiver in history , the Mississippi native was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2010 . Rice spent the majority of his career in San Francisco , plying his trade for the 49ers . Unsurprisingly , he is the runaway leader for all time receiving yards for the franchise with 19,247 yards . No other player for the 49ers has managed to break the 10,000-yard barrier . Having been on the receiving end of so many successful passes , Jerry Rice also leads the way in number of touchdowns for the 49ers – he scored 187 times for the San Francisco team , more than twice that of his closest rival , Terrell Owens . Leading quarterbacks Behind every great wide receiver is a great quarterback as without a perfect throw , the pass would never be completed . Drew Brees , who has been plying his trade as a quarterback in the NFL since 2001 , currently leads the way with the most passing yards in NFL history – he has passed a combined total of over 77 thousand yards for the San Diego Chargers and the New Orleans Saints , beating stiff competition from other legendary quarterbacks including Peyton Manning , Brett Favre , and Tom Brady . The skill and level of performance of these modern-day quarterbacks can be seen in the fact that the average completed passing yards per game stands at 234 yards – between 1950 and 1959 , this figure stood at just 167 yards .
