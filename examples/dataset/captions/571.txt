This statistic shows the regional distribution of the population in China in 2018 . That year , approximately 75.6 million people lived in Hebei province in China . Regional differences in China China is the world 's most populous country , with an exceptional economic growth momentum . The country can be roughly divided into three regions : Western , Eastern , and Central China . Western China covers the most remote regions from the sea . It also has the highest proportion of minority population and the lowest levels of economic output . Eastern China , on the other hand , enjoys a high level of economic development and international corporations . Central China lags far behind in comparison to the booming coastal regions . In order to accelerate the economic development of Western and Central Chinese regions , the PRC government has ramped up several incentive plans such as ‘ Rise of Central China ' and ‘ China Western Development ' _ . Economic power of different provinces When observed individually , some provinces could stand an international comparison . Jiangxi province , for example , a medium-sized Chinese province , had a larger population than the Ukraine or Argentina in 2018 . That year , the GDP of Zhejiang , an eastern coastal province , even exceeded the economic output of Sweden . In terms of per capita annual income , the municipality of Shanghai reached a level close to that of South Africa . Nevertheless , as shown by the Gini Index , China 's economic spur leaves millions of people in dust . Among the various kinds of economic inequality in China , regional or the so-called coast-inland disparity is one of the most significant . Posing as evidence for the rather large income gap in China , the poorest province Gansu had a per capita income similar to that of Sri Lanka that year .
