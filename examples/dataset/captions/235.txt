With the ease of internet access , the number of social media users in India stood at 326.1 million in 2018 . This increase is relatively lower as compared to the growth that occurred between 2016 and 2017 . Nevertheless , the social network users in the country were expected to be almost 448 million in 2023 . Facebook remained the popular choice among the social media platforms as of 2017 . What was the attraction and who was attracted to it ? The Indian Premier League , an annual cricket tournament conducted across major cities in the country might hold the answer . The IPL , one in many cricketing events followed religiously in India , had the highest attendance among all cricket leagues worldwide . Apart from the attendance , fans seemed to be keen on updates about their favorite teams . The IPL teams registered over 59 million likes on Facebook alone and more than 81 million followers on Twitter . Most of the Facebook usage came from the younger generation , aged between 18 - 24 years to be precise , with over 97 million users in 2018 . How was this achieved ? Increased availability of internet connections and access in recent years , propelled by the central government 's Digital India initiative was directly proportional in the growth of social media users . Internet penetration had been on the rise with almost 30 percent of the Indians being able to access the internet in 2016 , which made the South Asian country the second largest market globally after China .
