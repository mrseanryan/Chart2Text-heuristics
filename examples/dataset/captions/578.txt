This graph shows the average size of households in China from 1990 to 2018 . That year , approximately three people were living in an average Chinese household.Average number of people per household in China â€“ additional information A household is commonly defined as one person living alone or a group of people living together and sharing certain living accommodations . The average number of people living in one household in China dropped from 3.5 in 1990 to 2.87 in 2011 . Since 2011 , the figure was more or less stable and ranged between 2.87 and 3.17 people per household . The average Chinese household still counts as rather large in comparison to other industrial countries . In 2019 , an average American household consisted of only 2.52 people . Comparable figures have already been reached in the bigger cities and coastal areas of China , but in the rural provinces the household size is still much larger . According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China , the household size in China was diametrically correlated to its income . The receding size of Chinese households may be linked to the controversial one-child policy introduced in 1979 . The main aim of the policy was to control population growth . In 2017 , the fertility rate in China resided at 1.6 children per woman , much less than in the United States or in the United Kingdom . A partial ease in the one-child policy was introduced in 2013 , due to which couples where at least one parent was an only child were allowed to have a second child . In October 2015 , the law was changed into a two-child policy becoming effective in January 2016 .
