The Philippines ' inflation rate seems to have leveled off after peaking at more than 5 percent in 2018 and jumping up and down a few years prior . The Philippines are considered `` newly industrialized '' , but the economy relies on remittances from nationals overseas , and the services sector generates most of its GDP . Emerging and soon to develop ? After switching from agriculture to services and manufacturing , the Philippines are now an emerging economy , i.e . the country has some characteristics of a developed nation but is not quite there yet . In order to transition into a developed nation , the Philippines must meet certain requirements , like being able to sustain their economic development , being very open to foreign investors , or maintaining a very high stability of the institutional framework ( like law enforcement and the government ) . Only if these changes are irreversible can they be classified as a developed nation . The Philippines ' switch to services Ever since the switch to services and manufacturing , employment in these areas has increased and the country is now among those with the highest employment in the tourism industry worldwide . This transition was not entirely voluntary but also due to decreasing government support , the liberalization of trade , and reform programs . Still , agriculture is important for the country : As of 2017 , more than a quarter of Filipinos are still working in the agricultural sector , and urbanization has only increased very slightly over the last decade .
