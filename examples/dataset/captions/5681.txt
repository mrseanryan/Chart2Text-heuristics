The problem of unemployment in Italy became critical in the first years of the financial crisis which started in 2008 . Although the labor market crisis seriously affected the entire Italian working population , it particularly impacted the youngest part of the labor force . Between 2008 and 2014 alone , the share of unemployed individuals aged between 15 and 24 years increased by more than 15 percent . Despite a steady decline observed after 2014 , youth unemployment still stood at almost 29 percent in 2019 . Dream job versus harsh reality Newly graduated and often looking for a first job , young people are particularly vulnerable to stagnation in the labor market . Considering the difficulties in finding a job during and after the years of the financial crisis , about 48 percent of young Italians declared in 2018 that they would accept a job that does not meet their career aspiration . One fourth of the respondents stated that they would a accept a monthly salary of 500 euros . Greece and Italy with have the highest youth unemployment rates in the EU With about 33 percent of potential young workers without a job , Italy was the country with the second highest youth unemployment rate among the EU member states at the beginning of 2019 . The country with the highest youth unemployment was Greece , where about four in ten young individuals were unemployed .
