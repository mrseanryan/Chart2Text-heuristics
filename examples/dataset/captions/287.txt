The national team of Brazil has won the most soccer World Cup titles of all time with five , winning the tournament in 1958 , 1962 , 1970 , 1994 and , most recently , in 2002 . Didier Deschamps ' double success The most recent World Cup , which was hosted by Russia in 2018 , was won by France . The team , coached by Didier Deschamps , won the final 4 - 2 against Croatia . This marked a double success for the national team coach as he was part of the France squad that won the country 's first ever World Cup in 1998 . The 2018 victory for France was not a complete surprise as the French squad boasted the highest market value of all the teams at the World Cup , with a total value of around 1.08 billion euros . Brazil 's dominance beginning to fade ? Despite being the most successful nation in the history of the World Cup , Brazil 's national team has struggled in recent tournaments . Despite the team being full of superstars such as Neymar and Philippe Coutinho , the Brazilians were knocked out by Belgium in the quarter-finals in 2018 . There were high hopes for the Brazilian team at their home World Cup in 2014 and they seemed destined for glory as they made their way through to the semi-finals . However , in one of the most memorable games in World Cup history , the home team were unceremoniously dumped out by the Germans , who beat them 7 - 1 , before going on to claim the trophy against France in the final . This tournament marked the end of a glittering World Cup career for Germany 's Miroslav Klose , who is the all-time leading goal scorer at the World Cup . He scored his sixteenth and record-breaking goal in Germany 's semi-final matchup with Brazil at the 2014 World Cup .
