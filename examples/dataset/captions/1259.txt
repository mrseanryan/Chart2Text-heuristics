The gross domestic product ( GDP ) of Bangladesh grew to 288 billion U.S. dollars in 2018 . This is an increase of about 80 billion U.S. dollars since 2014 , and this growth is projected to continue at least until 2024 . Contributing factors Bangladesh is largely an export economy with a consistently negative trade balance . Much of its exports are manufactured goods , most notably garments . These goods are labor-intensive , and Bangladesh 's low wages make the country an attractive target for foreign direct investment . What does this mean for the Bangladeshi people ? Bangladesh has a large population , roughly twice that of Germany . As such , GDP per capita is still low compared to global averages . However , a rapid increase in GDP per capita usually indicates a higher level of development , driving increases in many aspects of the people 's lives . For example , a more developed health care system leads to a considerably lower infant mortality rate . In a wider sense , this means lifting millions of people out of poverty .
