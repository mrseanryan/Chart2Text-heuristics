The total number of banks and credit institutions in Italy steadily decreased from 2011 to 2018 , sinking from 740 to 505 units . Such a decrease in the number of banks in the country might be due to the financial crisis of the years 2007 and 2008 , which hit Italy quite harshly also in the following years . During the same period , the number of bank branches also decreased steadily , and , as a consequence , the population size per bank branch increased from 1,734 in 2008 to 2,067 in 2016 . Online banking on the rise The growing penetration of online banking , as well as the increasingly widespread use of banking apps via mobile devices also contributed to the gradual loss of importance of traditional banking and physical bank branches . It is also important to remember the rise of new players in the banking sector : digital banks and financial services providers have caught the attention of many customers in the last few years . Moreover , not only customers , but also financial institutions closely follow the development of this innovative business model and look with interest and curiosity at these new players . The bank of the future ? For Italians , traditional banks are still considered the preferred medium when it comes for example to loan financing and savings management . Nevertheless , digital banks and financial services providers are increasing in popularity because of more flexible , efficient and cheaper offers , which seem to be closer to the customers ' needs .
