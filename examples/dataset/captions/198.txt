The US CPI measures change in the price of consumer goods and services purchased by households and a key value in calculating US inflation and the health of the economy . The US Department of Labor 's Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates the CPI and defines it as , `` a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services . '' The BLS records the price of thousands of goods and services month by month . They consider goods and services within eight main categories : food and beverage , housing , apparel , transportation , medical care , recreation , education , and other goods and services . They aggregate the data collected in order to compare how much it would cost a consumer to buy the same market basket of goods and services one month or year against how much it cost in a previous month or year . Given that the CPI is used to calculate US inflation , the CPI influences the annual adjustments of many financial institutions in the United States , both private and public . Wages , social security payments , and pensions are all affected by the CPI .
