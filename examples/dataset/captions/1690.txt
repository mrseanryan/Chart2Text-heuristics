Over the last two decades , the household waste recycling rate in England has increased significantly from just 11.2 percent to almost 50 percent . However , England still falls short of the EU target of recycling a minimum of 50 percent of its household waste by 2020 . As of 2018 , Wales was the only nation in the UK to reach this target , and in 2017 recorded a recycling rate of 64 percent . Local authority barriers One issue with the amount of recycling that can be done is that not all local authorities collect the same materials . In 2017 , just 18 percent of local authorities in England collected plastic film , nearly half as many as in Wales . Plastic waste exports For many years , the UK relied on exporting plastic waste to China , with 24 percent of its plastic packaging waste exported there in 2017 . However , in the same year China announced it would introduce a ban on millions of tons of recycling waste imports from around the world . This poses a challenge to UK authorities , as in 2017 , 163 thousand metric tons of plastic packaging was exported to China .
