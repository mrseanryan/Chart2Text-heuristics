The statistic shows the growth rate of Australia 's real GDP from 2014 to 2018 , with projections up until 2024 . In 2018 , GDP in Australia grew by about 2.74 percent on the previous year.The recession-proof land down under GDP is one of the primary indicators used to gauge the state and health of a country 's economy . It is the total market value of all final goods and services that have been produced within a country in a given period of time , usually a year . GDP figures allow us to understand a country 's economy in a clear way . Real GDP , in a similar vein , is also a very useful indicator ; this is a measurement that takes prices changes ( inflation and deflation ) into account , therefore acting as a key indicator for economic growth . The gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth rate in Australia has , for sometime , been able to get a steady foothold in the somewhat shaky post-recession world , shaky , but far from catastrophic . The annual growth rate between the 2008 and 2009 financial years , for example , a time at which the world was brought to its proverbial knees , saw growth rates down under reach to 2.49 and 1.37 percent respectively on the previous years , whereas the GDP growth rate in the United States plummeted well into the minus zone . Australia , like all other capitalist nations , is at the mercy of international markets , and when the world economy takes a hit , it would be foolish to suggest it could emerge fully unscathed . However , Australia has earned some much deserved praise and attention owing to the fact that it has managed to remain recession-free for the past twenty years . This could be thanks to its abundance of raw materials , the Australian mining boom , the fact the recession came at a time of high commodity prices and , maybe most importantly , that just under a third of its exports go to China .
