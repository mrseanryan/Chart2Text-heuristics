This statistic displays the world 's largest hydroelectric dams as of 2018 , based on generating capacity . During this year , one of the largest hydropower facilities was located along the Columbia River in Washington , United States ; it had a generating capacity of 6.81 gigawatts . Three Gorges Dam â€“ additional informationChina is by far one of the strongest supporters of hydroelectric energy in the world . It is one of the cheapest energy facilities to maintain due to low operation costs . In the United States , the average expense for operating a hydroelectric power plant was about 6.65 mills per kilowatt hour in 2016 . As of 2018 , China accounted for 28.7 percent of global hydropower consumption . Four of the world 's top ten largest hydroelectric dams are located in China ; the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River is considered the largest dam in the world and has a generating capacity of 22,500 megawatts . It is located in the Hubei province and was completed in July 2012 . In addition to generating electricity , the dam was built with the intention to increase the river 's shipping capacity and reduce flooding downstream . The dam was expected to cost some 180 billion yuan but four years before completion , spending had already reached almost 150 billion yuan . There have been many controversies surrounding the Three Gorges Dam , including over 1.2 million people being displaced , as well as a number of cities and cultural sites being flooded . The project is also fraught with environmental problems , such as the erosion of riverbanks that have caused landslides and threatened fisheries in the East China Sea . The reservoir flooded over 632 square kilometers of land at its completion . In 2014 , China generated 1.06 petawatt hours of electricity from hydropower .
