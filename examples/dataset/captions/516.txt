The statistic shows the number of operable nuclear reactors as of June 2019 , by country . In the United Kingdom , 15 nuclear power reactors were in operation as of this time . Operable nuclear reactors are those connected to the grid . Number of operable nuclear power plants by country In 1954 , history was made when nuclear fission technology was approved for commercial purposes and the first nuclear power plant started operation in the Russian city of Obninsk . For the first time , it was possible to meet the demand of an increasingly energy-thirsty world â€“ at a reasonable price , too . The new energy proved to be an extremely reliable and stable form of electricity . Since nuclear power plants are only shut down for refuelling every two years or so , they provide an around-the-clock `` baseload '' supply of power to the people . In nuclear fission , uranium atoms are split apart into lighter elements . Uranium is a radioactive metal that is extracted from mines , mainly in Kazakhstan , Canada and Australia . After the uranium splitting process , the used fuel elements are still radioactive and have to be stored in nuclear waste repositories or spent fuel pools . These sites are often underground and require thick metal or concrete walls to shield the public from radiation . In the past , several accidents at nuclear power plants - including Three Mile Island , Chernobyl and Fukushima -have shown just how dangerous radioactivity is , once it is released into the environment . Currently , there are 450 nuclear reactors in operation in some 30 countries around the world . One of the largest plants is situated in France , where about 70 percent of total electricity generation was derived from nuclear sources in 2018 . In 2011 , the alliance between General Electric and Hitachi was ranked as the third largest maker of nuclear reactors , behind France 's Areva and Russia-based Rosatom . The nuclear power plant market was sized at around 30 billion US dollars in 2011 , and is expected to exceed 50 billion US dollars by 2030 . In 2050 , global nuclear power capacity is projected to reach 516 gigawatts .
