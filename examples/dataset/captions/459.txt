Among member countries of the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) , the United States have one of the highest densities of magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) units . Nearly 38 such units are available per every million of its population . Germany and South Korea follow with rates of some 34 and 29 per one million of its inhabitants . Compared to these countries , Israel has around five and Hungary four MRI units per every million . The density of diagnostic imaging units can be one measurement to define the quality of a country 's health care infrastructure . Why and when MRI is used The invention of MRI scanners revolutionized diagnostic imaging as it does n't use radiation , but a magnetic field and radio waves . Since ionized radiation as used in CT-scans and X-rays is potentially harmful for the patient , this includes a significant advantage for MRIs . MRI scans are principally used for imaging organs , soft tissues , ligaments , and other parts of the body which are difficult to see . While on the other hand , computer tomography ( CT ) scanners are more frequently used to show bony structures . Among the global top manufacturers of MRI scanners are General Electric , Siemens , Hitachi , and Philips . The costs of MRI A single scan per MRI could cost up to 4,000 U.S. dollars , and thus double the cost of a scan with CT . The purchase of an MRI scanner could be a major investment for a practice or a hospital , with prices ranging from 150 thousand dollars up to several million dollars . Of course , there are installation and maintenance costs to be taken into account as well . With nearly 40 million MRI scans performed annually in the United States , it 's clear that diagnostic imaging costs are substantial .
