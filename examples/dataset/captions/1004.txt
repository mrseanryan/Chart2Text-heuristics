What is the average price of residential property in the Netherlands ? In the fourth quarter of 2019 , a single-family home cost approximately 344,000 euros . There were large differences between the Dutch provinces , however . Single-family homes were most expensive in the central province of Utrecht with an average price of 454,000 euros , whereas a similar house in Groningen had an average price tag of 225,000 euros . Overall , the average price a private individual would pay when buying any type of existing residential property ( such as single-family homes but also , for example , an apartment ) was approximately 287,000 euros in 2018 . Do the Dutch prefer to buy or to rent a house ? The Netherlands had a slightly higher home ownership rate ( the share of owner-occupied dwellings of all homes ) in 2017 than other countries in Northwestern Europe . 69 percent of all Dutch houses were owned , whereas this percentage was roughly 51 percent in Germany and 64 percent in France . This is an effect of past developments : the price to rent ratio ( the nominal purchase price of a house divided by the annual rent of a similar place ) shows that for a long time it was relatively cheaper to buy a property in the Netherlands than to rent one . Life for rent : mortgages in the Netherlands Additionally , the Netherlands has one of the highest mortgage debts among private individuals in Europe . In 2018 , total debt reached a value of approximately 714 billion euros . This has a political background as the Dutch tax system allowed homeowners for many years to deduct interest paid on mortgage from pre-tax income for a maximum period of thirty years , essentially allowing for income support for homeowners . In the Netherlands , this system is known as hypotheekrenteaftrek . Note that since 2014 , the Dutch government is slowly scaling this down with a planned acceleration from 2020 onwards .
