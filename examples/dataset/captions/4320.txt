Sports Direct accomplished an impressive feat with its revenue figures in the past few years . The British sports fashion retailer registered a revenue of about 3.7 billion British pounds in 2019 , doubling what it made in 2013 . The retailer 's success owes much to a number of acquisitions made under its CEO Mike Ashley , who owns the football club New Castle United besides his reputation as a retail mogul . European stores nothing short of home numbers Sports Direct is an international sports fashion retailer with stores in numerous European countries . Currently , in the UK the retailer boasts a notable number of both own-brand stores and fascias owned by the group . In the meantime , the retailer 's European businesses are catching up with the UK , with ever increasing store number operating in this market . Keen on buy-outs Sports Direct loves saving high street retailers from their financial misery . Most recently , the Group fully acquired the department store House of Fraser after the retailer went into administration in August 2018 . Since then , Sports Direct 's retail portfolio extended beyond sports fashion with hints at going in the same direction as the retailer was reported to eye more buy-outs .
