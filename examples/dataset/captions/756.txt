In 2017 , the total population of the Philippines was at approximately 104.92 million inhabitants . For the foreseeable future , the Filipino population is expected to increase slightly , despite a current overall downward trend in population growth . The dwindling Filipino population For now , the population figures in the Philippines still show a steady increase and the country is still one of the most densely populated countries in the Asia-Pacific region , however , all signs point to a decline in the number of inhabitants in the long run : Just like the population growth rate , the country 's fertility rate , for example , has also been decreasing for years now , while the death rate has been increasing simultaneously . Poor healthcare to blame One of the reasons for the downward trend is the aging population ; fewer babies are born each year , while life expectancy at birth has been steady over the years . Another reason is poor healthcare in the country : The Philippines have a high tuberculosis incidence rate , a highly infectious disease , and are among the countries with a high probability of death from noncommunicable diseases as well .
