The Dallas Cowboys had an operating income of 420 million U.S. dollars in 2018 , the largest of all the NFL teams and almost double the figure of the team ranked second , the New England Patriots . At the other end of the rankings , the Oakland Raiders had the smallest operating income in the league at 28 million U.S. dollars . Cowboys top the rich list Operating income refers to how much of a team 's revenue will become profit after deducting operating expenses , such as wages . The average operating income of an NFL team was around 102 million U.S. dollars in 2018 . The Cowboys generated overall revenues of 950 million U.S. dollars in 2018 and not only ranked as the most valuable NFL team , but also the most valuable sports team worldwide â€“ despite not playing in the Super Bowl since the 1995 season . Raiders gamble on Las Vegas move The annual revenue of the Oakland Raiders has increased since 2001 , but it was still the lowest of all 32 NFL teams in 2018 . However , this may change over the next few years because the franchise is moving to a new stadium in a new city : Las Vegas . The team is scheduled to play as the Las Vegas Raiders from the start of the 2020 NFL season , and the relocation is expected to generate more revenue from sponsorships , especially from the naming rights deal for the new stadium .
