Between 2008 and 2018 , each year the Netherlands produced between 712,000 and 887,800 kilograms of cheese . Production peaked in 2016 , after which it fell again slightly . In 2018 , the most recent available year , production was 880,281 kilograms . According to a recent forecast , cheese production in the Netherlands is expected to increase in the near future . By 2025 , the production of cheese in the country is expected to reach nearly one billion kilograms . Cheese exports Although the Dutch are enthusiastic cheese consumers , eating roughly 22 kilograms of cheese per capita per year , it is impossible for a country of some 17 million inhabitants to eat all that cheese by itself . Most of the cheese produced in the Netherlands is therefore exported abroad . In 2018 , the most important trading partner for cheese was neighboring country Germany . That year , nearly 277 million kilograms of cheese were exported to Germany . Where does the cheese go ? Most of the Dutch cheese exports were destined for other European countries , but a considerable share of the cheese produced in the Netherlands was also exported to Japan and the United States . Exports to Japan accounted for roughly three percent of all Dutch cheese exports , whereas two percent of exported cheese was shipped to the United States .
