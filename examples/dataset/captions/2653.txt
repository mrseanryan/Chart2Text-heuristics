In 2018 , the urban population in Malaysia was approximately 24.4 million . In the years since 2005 , the urban population in Malaysia had been steadily increasing , and as is in line with global trends , it is projected to increase further in the future . Rapid urbanization In 2017 , approximately 75 percent of Malaysia 's population lived in urban areas and cities . This puts Malaysia as one of Southeast Asia 's most urbanized countries . The metropolitan area of Greater Kuala Lumpur had a population of more than seven million in that year , making it Malaysia 's biggest urban area . However , about twice as many Malaysians lived in cities with half a million inhabitants or less . Urban-rural divide For many Malaysians , urbanization brought about more and better economic opportunities and job prospects . The average monthly income for urban households was more than three thousand ringgit higher than that of rural households . Poverty rates in rural areas were also significantly higher than that in urban areas . Even so , the countryside still holds a nostalgic place in the hearts of Malaysians , encapsulated in the romanticized idea of the â€˜ kampung ' or Malay village .
