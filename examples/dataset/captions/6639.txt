The average total home attendance per team across the NFL during the 2019 regular season was 521,089 , the lowest figure recorded in recent years . The franchise with the highest total attendance for its eight regular-season home games was the Dallas Cowboys and the team with the lowest was the Los Angeles Chargers . A time-out to review NFL attendances The relocation of the Chargers from San Diego to Los Angeles continued to be a major reason why the NFL average total home attendance per team was the lowest for many years . The team 's move resulted in a 56 percent decrease in the team 's total regular-season home attendance between 2016 and 2017 , and although more fans attended during the 2018 and 2019 season , the figures are well below what they were in San Diego . The biggest decrease across the NFL between 2017 and 2018 was at the Washington Redskins . On the field , the team had identical records in both regular seasons , but the total regular-season home attendance dropped by 19 percent . NFL scores TV ratings boost The total number of fans attending games may have slightly decreased across the NFL in 2018 , but the average television viewership of the regular season increased by around one million viewers in the United States . These figures were boosted by an increase in the average number of viewers watching Thursday Night Football and Monday Night Football in the United States in 2018 . However , television viewership of the Super Bowl in the United States continues to decline : the lowest number of television viewers for more than ten years watched the showpiece culmination of the 2018 NFL season .
