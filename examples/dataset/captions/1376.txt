This statistic shows the unemployment rate of the Ukraine from 1999 to 2019 . In 2019 , the unemployment rate of the Ukraine amounted to approximately 9.31 percent of the total labor force . The economic situation in Ukraine Amid the political and economic crisis , Ukraine 's unemployment is rising . When Russia seized and annexed Crimea in March of 2014 , pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych was also ousted and the economy of Ukraine took a hard hit . This resulted in sharp reductions in Ukraine 's GDP , and likely caused a sharp increase in unemployment as well . Before the turmoil , Russia was Ukraine 's most important import and export partner , having a significant impact on GDP after tension arose . Meanwhile , Ukraine was and still is getting itself out of economic despair ; Ukraine has amassed more debt with the IMF than Greece and is trying to reduce this debt by implementing hyper-austerity , which involves making cuts to public spending . Spending on unemployment and disability insurance is a part of these cuts , which is not ideal for the Ukrainian people considering that the unemployment rate is expected to reach a rate of 11.47 percent in 2015 . In times of increasing unemployment , a struggling economy and an inflation rate reaching almost 50 percent , 2015 is and will be a tough , if not desastrous year for the Ukrainian people . However , the outlook beyond 2015 is brighter and hopefully unemployment will drop beyond its peak in 2015 .
