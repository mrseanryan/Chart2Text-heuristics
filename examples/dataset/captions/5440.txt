American patriotism 81 percent of the American population seems to be very to extremely proud to be American , and they are n't shy to show it off : Around 60 percent of the population owns an American flag and around 44 percent own apparel branding patriotic imagery or symbols . Interestingly , patriotism seems to span the generations as well , with Millennials being only slightly less patriotic than the Gen X'ers or even the Baby Boomers . Ingrained patriotism is also one of the reasons why so many American men have chosen to fight in wars throughout history , and more than 80 percent of adults between the ages of 85 and 90 are now veterans . The number of veteran men under age 55 is noticeably lower , by the way , even though patriotism is alive and well and the U.S. is still sending soldiers to war zones . While Americans are overwhelmingly proud to be American , it is also worthwhile to see how the public opinion of the United States varies across different regions and countries of the world : While the United States enjoys a fairly favorable standing in Africa , for example , only a third of the Middle Eastern population views the United States favorably , most likely due to its controversial military involvement in the region .
