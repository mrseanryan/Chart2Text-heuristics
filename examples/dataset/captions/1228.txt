When it comes to audience reach , the messaging app Line reigns supreme among social network users in Japan . While globally leading networks such as Twitter , Instagram or Facebook do get their fair share of popularity within the Japanese social media market , Line 's audience reach is on average more than twice as high as those of other platforms , peaking at approximately 80 million monthly actives users in Japan during the first quarter of 2019 . What makes Line so popular ? The success story of messaging service Line , a Japanese subsidiary of South Korean internet powerhouse Naver , started back in 2011 during the Great East Japan Earthquake . While most conventional communication channels had broken down due to power failures , official sources as well as private individuals turned to online options for communicating news and confirming the safety of friends and family members . The app was released for public use later that year , appealing greatly to Japanese consumers due to its unique and customizable design , allowing both private and business usage simultaneously . Line 's annual revenue rose from under seven billion Japanese yen in fiscal year 2012 to over 207 billion yen in fiscal 2018 , laying down the company 's major success in numbers . How do Japanese use social networks ? Compared to its neighboring countries , the Japanese market has a relatively low social network penetration rate of only 61 percent , being noticeably outpaced by Taiwan with 89 and South Korea with 85 percent audience reach . As of January 2019 , internet users in Japan spent an average of 4.8 hours per day consuming digital content , with young Japanese aged 18 to 34 using up to six hours of their time every day for online media consumption , including social networks . Leading reasons for using social media among younger generations are the convenience of gathering and sharing information , as well as connecting with friends and colleagues .
