In 2018 , there were roughly 3.3 million German households with a household net income of under 900 euros per month . In total , there were approximately 40.4 million private households in Germany that year . Disposable net income Based on most recent figures , the largest number of households had a monthly net income of 3,200 to 4,500 euros . While at first glance this amount may seem substantial , based on general German standards of living , it 's worth noting that flexibility and expenditure depends on the number of people living in a household , or rather the number of earners in relation to that number . In the case of employed population members , what remains as disposable net income is influenced by various regular payments made by households after the already taxed salary arrives . These payments include , but are not limited to , rent , different types of insurance , repaying loans , fees for internet and mobile phone services . Food and housing When looking at private household spending in Germany , consistent patterns emerge . Housing , water , electricity , gas and other fuel made up the largest share , followed by food , beverages and tobacco . Spending for the latter has only been going up in recent years .
