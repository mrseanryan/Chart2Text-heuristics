According to quarterly pulse monitors , the growth of residential property prices in the Netherlands is expected to slow down in 2019 and 2020 . In 2020 , housing prices are believed to increase with three percent . This is significantly less than in August 2019 , when residential real estate prices grew with approximately 5.7 percent when compared to the same month a year before . The average price for a house in the Netherlands was approximately 287,000 euros in 2018 . This forecast could change quite drastically , thoughâ€¦ The source mentions there is a lot of uncertainty whether this prediction will hold true . This has to do with the so-called `` nitrogen decision '' ( in Dutch : stikstofbesluit ) in May 2019 . Simply put , a Dutch advisory body found that the domestic policy for nitrogen emission ( formally known as Programmatische Aanpak Stikstof or Programmatic Approach Nitrogen ) went against European rules . As of August 2019 , a sizable share of the Dutch population was not familiar with this nitrogen policy . However , the advisory body 's decision led to an immediate stop to all construction in the country ( amongst other things ) . By the end of 2019 , this stop was still in place . How about the housing market in Amsterdam ? Amsterdam , Haarlem and Haarlemmermeer ( two areas surrounding the Dutch capital ) were the cities and/or municipalities with the highest house prices in 2018 . On average , a house in Amsterdam sold for over 115,000 euros more than a house in Utrecht . Amsterdam was also well above the average rents found in other cities . A house in Amsterdam had a rent of approximately 23 euros per square meter in 2019 , whereas rents in Rotterdam costed roughly 16 euros per square meter . It should be noted , however , that rent changes in the Dutch capital are significantly lower than those found in Rotterdam and especially Utrecht .
