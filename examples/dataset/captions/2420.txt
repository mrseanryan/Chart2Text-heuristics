This statistic shows the distribution of causes of deforestation in Canada in 2015 . Forty-one percent of deforestation in Canada in 2015 was caused by agriculture . Deforestation Deforestation is the intentional destruction of forested land for permanent reuse for agricultural , urban , industrial , or other non-forest operations . It is distinguished from natural disturbances such as forest fires and insect damage which are unplanned and while damaging to forested land , do not permanently destroy a forest . Canada has increased the area of land which is protected from deforestation year after year , totaling over 1 million square kilometers in 2014 , a 50 percent increase since 2000 . According to Natural Resources Canada , the Canadian government department responsible for the management of natural resources , deforestation has declined from 64,000 hectares lost in 1990 to 45,800 hectares lost in 2012 , a 28 percent reduction . The majority of deforestation in Canada is due to the agricultural industry , accounting for 41 percent of all causes . Resource extraction , such as mining and oil drilling , comes in at a close second of 37 percent . As of 2010 , 18,900 hectares of forested land was repurposed for agricultural use . This pales in comparison to the area of land affected by insect damage and forest fires . In 2014 , 20.3 million hectares of forest was suffering moderate to severe defoliation due to insect damage and 4.6 million hectares of land was burned by forest fire .
