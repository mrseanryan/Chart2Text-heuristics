The travel and tourism industry contributed to the French Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) in total with approximately 204.3 billion euros in 2017 . The source predicted that this contribution will increase in the coming ten years , reaching an expected total of around 248.1 billion euros in 2028 . In 2017 , France welcomed almost 87 million international tourists , making it the most visited country in the world in that year . France was the most attractive country for tourists in 2017 Most of those visitors came from the other side of the Channel : France welcomed in that same year a total of 12.7 million tourists from the United Kingdom . Further 11.8 million tourists from Germany also visited France . Nonetheless , non-European residents seem to have contributed more to the French tourism revenues than other European tourists , as they spent on average 9.4 nights in France in 2014 . International tourists spend less in Paris During the year 2017 alone , international visitors spent a total of 13.05 billion U.S. dollars in Paris , representing a decrease of approximately six billion U.S. dollars in comparison to a peak in 2013 , whilst the opposite trend is observed for the number of international tourists .
