In debitum incrementum ? A country 's national debt , also known as government debt or public debt , is defined as all borrowings owed by the government of a country . It usually comprises internal debt – owed to other governmental departments – and external debt , which is held by the public and is owed to government bond owners . National debt can be caused by a struggling economy in general , or by low tax income , which usually leads to money being borrowed from other governments for support , which in turn can not be paid back right away .
