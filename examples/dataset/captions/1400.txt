In 2018 , Gmail was the second-most popular e-mail client , accounting for 27 percent of e-mail opens , ranking behind the Apple iPhone e-mail client with 29 percent of e-mail opens . The prevalence of these two leading e-mail clients highlights the dominance of mobile when it comes to e-mail opens â€“ mobile e-mail accounted for 43 percent of opens as of December 2018 , whereas webmail accounted for 39 percent . This is not particularly surprising given that online usage has undergone a strong shift towards mobile in recent years .
