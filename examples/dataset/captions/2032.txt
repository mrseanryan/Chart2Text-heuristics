In 2017 , the country welcomed over 10 million foreign tourists , generating foreign exchange earnings of over 27.31 billion U.S. dollars . Domestic travel on the rise With a rich culture , ancient monuments , and mesmerizing natural beauty , India is one of the leading tourist destinations in the world . This holds true not only for foreign tourists , but also for the increasingly monied middle-class of the country who are spending more time and money than ever before on domestic travel . In 2017 , the domestic expenditure on tourism was around 186 billion U.S. dollars . At the same time , the collective government spending on the tourism sector that year was about 2.61 billion dollars . The cost of tourism It comes as no surprise that out of the most visited monuments in India , the Taj Mahal in Agra ranks number one for both foreign as well as domestic tourists . Along with these popular tourist destinations , travellers are also exploring many other destinations in the country , like the pristine high-altitude plains of Leh and Ladakh or the lush green north-eastern forests . It now remains to be seen whether and how well the country manages to balance the influx of people with its efforts for the historical sites and natural resources conservation .
