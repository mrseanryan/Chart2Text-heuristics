According to a national pet owners survey , there was a total of approximately 95.6 million cats living in households in the United States in 2017 . In the same year , some 68 percent of all U.S. households owned at least one pet . Increasing pet expenditure Whilst the number of households owning cats , and pets in general , has remained relatively consistent over the last few years , pet industry expenditure has steadily grown . Consumers are expected to spend a record breaking 75.38 billion U.S. dollars on their pets in 2019 . The majority of pet market revenue comes from food sales , followed by veterinary care costs . Shopping location preferences When it comes to shopping locations , most consumers still purchase their pet products in physical retail stores . However , the number of consumers buying pet products online is on the rise . Dry cat food was the number one pet product bought online by cat owners in the United States in 2018 .
