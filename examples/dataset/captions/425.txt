In 2018 , American tech company IBM employed around 351 thousand people worldwide , continuing a general trend of declining number of employees over the past six years since 2012 . IBM has been facing declining revenues and consequently is trying to restructure its business model , which could partly explain the decreasing number of current employees . Since early 2019 , IBM is facing a class action lawsuit that claims the company violated federal law against age discrimination , though IBM maintains it makes its employment decisions based on skills . Valuing employee skillset and retention In the instances of skilled employees that the company would like to retain , the tech industry is notorious for a high turnover rate of 13 percent . IBM faces this familiar tenure problem and recently advanced its artificial intelligence ( AI ) work devoted to the retention of its most skilled employees and purchased a patent for a â€˜ 'predictive attrition program ' _ ' to predict employee departure and prescribe actions to intervene . IBM 's AI has been a significant source of its research and development costs , in particular its artificial intelligence software Watson , making it one of the top five business intelligence software vendors . However , it is unclear if Watson can give IBM the revenue boost it needs , as IBM 's revenue has stagnated in recent years .
