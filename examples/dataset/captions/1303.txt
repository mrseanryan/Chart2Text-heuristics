According to the monitoring data from the Embassy of the United States , there was on average 63.19 micrograms of PM2.5 particles per cubic meter to be found in the air in Beijing during the first month of 2017 . Since then , the Embassy of the United States in Beijing has stopped publishing data on Beijing 's air pollution . Reasons for air pollution in Beijing China 's capital city Beijing is one of the most populous cities in China with over 20 million inhabitants . Over the past 20 years , Beijing 's GDP has increased tenfold . With the significant growth of vehicles and energy consumption in the country , Beijing 's air quality is under great pressure from the economic development . In the past , the city had a high level of coal consumption . Especially in winter , in which coal consumption increased due to heating , the air quality could get extremely bad on the days without wind . In spring , the wind from the north would bring sand from Mongolian deserts , resulting in severe sandstorms in Beijing . The bad air quality also affected the air visibility and threatened people 's health . On days with very bad air quality , people wearing masks for protection can be seen on the streets in the city . Methods to improve air quality in Beijing Over the past years , the government has implemented various methods to improve the air quality in Northern China . Sandstorms , which were quite common 15 years ago , are now rarely seen in Beijing 's spring thanks to afforestation projects on China 's northern borders . The license-plate lottery system was introduced in Beijing to restrict the growth of private vehicles . Large trucks were not allowed to enter certain areas in Beijing . Above all , the coal consumption in Beijing has been restricted by shutting down industrial sites and improving heating systems . Beijing 's efforts to improve air quality has also been highly praised by the UN as a successful model for other cities . However , there is also criticism pointing out that the improvement of Beijing 's air quality is based on the sacrifice of surrounding provinces ( including Hebei ) , as many factories were moved from Beijing to other regions . Besides air pollution , there are other environmental problems like water pollution that China is facing . The industrial transformation is the key to China 's environmental improvement .
