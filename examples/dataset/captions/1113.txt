Thailand 's gross domestic product ( GDP ) grew at a rate of 4 percent in 2017 . It is expected to grow slightly faster in the coming year before converging to a long-run growth rate around 3.6 percent . This steady growth can be attributed to Thailand 's relatively developed economy . The Thai economy Thailand relies less on agriculture and more on employment in the service sector , which is a sign of a more advanced economy . This development is also apparent in its GDP per capita , which is one of the highest in Southeast Asia . One aspect of a developed economy is that it is more diverse , and thus less exposed to economic shocks . This statistic reflects that robustness in its optimistic view of Thai GDP growth . Domestic factors Thailand has posted an incredibly low unemployment rate for several years , which suggests that the workforce matches the demand for labor remarkably well .
