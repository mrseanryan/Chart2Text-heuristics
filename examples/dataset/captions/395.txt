This survey shows the top 15 Jobs in the U.S. with the highest divorce rate , based on an analysis of the 2000 U.S. Census data . The divorce rate of maids and housekeeping cleaners amounts to about 26 percent . Jobs in the United States The employment rate in the United States changed constantly over the last few years . It has shifted from 61.7 percent in 1991 to 64.4 percent in 2000 and stood at 58.6 percent in 2013 . An employed person is someone who did any work for pay or profit , persons who did at least 15 hours of unpaid work in a family-operated enterprise ; and persons who were temporarily absent from their regular jobs because of illness , vacation , bad weather , industrial dispute , or various personal reasons . The development in the employment rate can be seen as a reflection of the economic downfall resulting from the economic crisis . Although the U.S. economy has been getting back on its feet in the last few years , the employment situation is still far from the 2009 level . This is also showing in the assessment of the American people of the economic situation . In March 2014 , about 66 percent of U.S. Americans felt that it was a bad time to find quality job in the United States , whereas 30 percent felt optimistic to find a quality job in the United States at that time . The employment situation in a country obviously has a strong influence on peoples ' lives . A possible negative effect that a low employment rate could have on the U.S. child birth rate is illustrated here : about 65 percent of U.S. American adults said that a reason for not having more children could be the cost of raising a children and not having enough money to afford a child . The average cost of raising a child from birth to age 18 in the United States totaled to nearly 226,920 U.S. dollars per child . This can often hardly be covered with low wage jobs . For example , fast food workers were among the lowest paid jobs in the United States with an average hourly wage of about 9.09 U.S. dollars .
