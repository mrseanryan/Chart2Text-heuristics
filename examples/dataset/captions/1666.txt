In 2018 , over 66 percent of South Africa 's total population lived in urban areas and cities . Urbanization defines the share of urban population from the total population of a country . Just like urbanization , the population density within the nation has risen , reaching 46 inhabitants per square kilometer , meaning more people are sharing less space . Many opportunities for work and leisure can be found in the urban locations of South Africa , and as such the five largest municipalities each now have over three million residents . Facing its economic strengths and drawbacks South Africa is a leading services destination , as it is one of the most industrialized countries in the continent of Africa . The majority of the country 's gross domestic product comes from the services sector , where more than 70 percent of the employed population works . Unemployment is seen as a critical indicator of the state of an economy , and for South Africa , a high rate of over 25 percent could indicate a need for a shift in economic policy . As of 2017 , South Africa was one of the twenty countries with the highest rate of unemployment in the world .
