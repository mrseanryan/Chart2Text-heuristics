260 patients died on the organ transplant waiting list while waiting for a kidney transplant in the United Kingdom ( UK ) during the period 2018/19 , by far the highest number compared to other organs . In the year to March 2018 , 63 and 45 people also died waiting for lung and liver transplants respectively . Transplant situation in the UK The number of people waiting for a kidney transplant in the UK was over 4.7 thousand in 2019 , which was the highest for any organ by quite a distance . Again , this was followed by individuals waiting for liver transplants and lung transplants with 407 and 339 patients each respectively . The problem exists is that in 2017/18 the number of potential donors was over 4.5 times the number of actual donors in the UK . Survival chances after a transplant In the UK , the one-year survival rate after a kidney transplant is generally good . Since 2005 , 99 percent of those receiving a kidney transplant from a living donor survived for at least one-year post-transplant . The survival rates from deceased donors are slightly below , sitting at a 97 percent survival rate for the period 2014 to 2017 .
