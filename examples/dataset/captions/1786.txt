Thomas Cook 's revenues rose in 2018 to approximately 9.6 billion British pounds . The Group had responded to customer demand by expanding their summer and winter programs in 2017 , helping to increase revenue . However the summer heatwave of 2018 negatively impacted sales towards the end of the fiscal year , resulting in a pre-tax loss of 53 million pounds . The company collapsed in 2019 after failing to secure a government bailout . Why did Thomas Cook collapse ? On September 23 , 2019 , the Thomas Cook Group was forced to cease operations after negotiations to save the holiday travel firm from administration failed , leaving a reported 600,000 customers stranded abroad and thousands of staff without jobs . It is thought that the company succumbed to the same challenging market conditions that led to the collapse of another British airline and travel group , Monarch , in 2017 . However Thomas Cook already had it 's own problems , as it had suffered from massive debts since forming as a merger between Thomas Cook AG and package holiday operator MyTravel Group plc in 2007 . In the intervening years , various mergers and acquisitions had helped Thomas Cook to remain a major player ( the brand became the UK 's largest travel agency on the high street following a merger and eventual buyout of Co-operative Travel in the early 2010s ) . But ultimately its finances could not be saved , as rescue talks to secure the funding needed to prevent them going into liquidation failed . Thomas Cook 's history Prior to its collapse , Thomas Cook was the world 's oldest travel company . Its origins date back to the 19th century , with the founding of the Thomas Cook & Son travel company that originally organized tours from the United Kingdom ( UK ) to Europe and the United States . The brand 's legacy survived through mergers and acquisitions of other travel companies and airlines , with the Thomas Cook Group forming in 2007 . Thomas Cook 's business segments were primarily airline and tour operations , with its main markets in the UK and continental Europe . Thomas Cook Airlines Limited , the UK airline business , reported their revenues separately .
