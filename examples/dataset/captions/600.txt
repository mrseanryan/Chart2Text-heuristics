The statistic shows GDP per capita in the United Kingdom from 1984 to 2018 , with projections up until 2024 . In 2018 , GDP per capita in the United Kingdom was at around 42,579.82 US dollars . The same year , the total UK population amounted to about 64.6 million people . The United Kingdom is among the leading countries in a world GDP ranking.Falling unemployment in a time of recession GDP is a useful indicator when it comes to measuring the state of a nation 's economy . GDP is the market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time , usually a year . GDP per capita equals exactly the GDI ( gross domestic income ) per capita and is not a measure of an individual 's personal income . As can be seen clearly in the statistic , gross domestic product ( GDP ) per capita in the United Kingdom is beginning to increase , albeit not to pre-recession levels . The UK is beginning to see signs of an economic recovery , though as of yet it remains unclear what sort of recovery this is . Questions have been raised as to whether the growth being seen is the right sort of growth for a well balanced recovery across the necessary sectors . An interesting oddity occurred in the United Kingdom for nine months in 2012 , which saw a decreasing unemployment occurring at the same time as dip in nationwide economic productivity . This seems like good - if not unusual - news , but could be indicative of people entering part-time employment . It could also suggest that labor productivity is falling , meaning that the UK would be less competitive as a nation . The figures continue to rise , however , with an increase in employment in the private sector . With the rate of inflation in the UK impacting everyone 's daily lives , it is becoming increasingly difficult for vulnerable groups to maintain a decent standard of living .
