The FIFA World Cup is not only one of the biggest prizes in sport , it also boasts a big prize pot . The total prize money for the 2018 World Cup in Russia stood at 791 million U.S. dollars , a significant increase on the 576 million U.S. dollars up for grabs at the previous World Cup in Brazil in 2014 . France take home the big prize Thanks to their success at the 2018 World Cup , France not only took home the coveted trophy , but also bagged a record 35 million U.S. dollars in prize money . The 25 million U.S. dollars handed out to the runners-up , Croatia , would have been little consolation to losing out on the biggest trophy in international soccer . Even the teams that were knocked out in the group stages of the 2018 World Cup , which included the likes of Serbia , Germany , and Australia , were given eight million U.S. dollars as consolation . Big talent = Big moneyAt the World Cup , the big money is not just limited to the prize money but is also evident in the squads themselves . Given the fact that they came out on top in the 2018 World Cup , it is unsurprising that France boasted the squad with the highest transfer value . On the other end of the spectrum , minnows Panama , with a combined market value of just over nine million euros , were not able to shake off their underdog status as they lost every game in their group . According to their market value , Lionel Messi of Argentina and Neymar of Brazil were the two biggest stars at the 2018 World Cup . However , they were unable to lead their teams to glory as Argentina were knocked out by eventual champions , France , in the round of 16 and Brazil fell victim to Belgium in the quarter-finals .
