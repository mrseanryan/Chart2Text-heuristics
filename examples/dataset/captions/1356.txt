The statistic depicts the median age of the population in the United Kingdom from 1950 to 2050  . The median age of a population is an index that divides the population into two equal groups : half of the population is older than the median age and the other half younger . In 2015 , the median age of United Kingdom 's population was 40 years . Population of the United Kingdom The United Kingdom ( UK ) includes Great Britain ( England , Scotland and Wales ) and Northern Ireland , and is a state located off the coast of continental Europe . The United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy , which means the Queen acts as representative head of state , while laws and constitutional issues are discussed and passed by a parliament . The total UK population figures have been steadily increasing , albeit only slightly , over the last decade ; in 2011 , the population growth rate was lower than in the previous year for the first time in eight years . Like many other countries , the UK and its economy were severely affected by the economic crisis in 2009 . Since then , the unemployment rate has doubled and is only recovering slowly . UK inhabitants tend to move to the cities to find work and better living conditions ; urbanization in the United Kingdom has been on the rise . At the same time , population density in the United Kingdom has been increasing due to several factors , for example , the rising number of inhabitants and their life expectancy at birth , an increasing fertility rate , and a very low number of emigrants . In fact , the United Kingdom is now among the 20 countries with the highest life expectancy at birth worldwide . As can be seen above , the median age of UK residents has also been increasing significantly since the seventies ; another indicator for a well-working economy and society .
