Japan 's economy Japan is the world 's second largest developed economy and a member of the Group of Eight , also known as G8 , which is comprised of the eight leading industrialized countries . Due to a weak financial sector , overregulation and a lack of demand , Japan suffered substantially from the early 1990s until 2000 , a time referred to as â€˜ 'The Lost Decade ' _ ' . Japan 's economy is still slowly recovering from the country 's asset price bubble collapse ; however it continues to struggle to retain economic milestones achieved in the 1980s . Japan 's response to the crash was to stimulate the economy , which in turn resulted in extensive amounts of debt that further increased into the 21st century , most notably after the 2008 financial crisis . Despite maintaining a surprisingly low unemployment rate , demand within the country remains inadequate , primarily because Japanese residents spend a rather small fraction of the money they earned from the workplace . Lower demand often has a direct effect on production , with companies seeing not enough profits to continue production at such a high rate . Based on the consumer confidence index , Japanese households found that their quality of life , income growth , employment and propensity to durable goods was below satisfactory standards , perhaps due to these households still experiencing the effects of the 1990s bubble crash .
