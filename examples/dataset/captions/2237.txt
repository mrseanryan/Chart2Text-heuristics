Sulfur dioxide ( SO2 ) emissions in the United States have decreased significantly over the last decades . SO2 emissions have fallen to 2.82 million tons in 2017 , in comparison to 31.22 million tons in 1970 . This reduction in SO2 is largely due to the implementation of the Acid Rain Program under the Clean Air Act through a cap and trade program for fossil-fuel powered plants . What is sulfur dioxide and how does it impact health and the environment ? SO2 is largely used as an indicator for gaseous sulfur oxides ( SOx ) as these gases are found in low concentrations in the atmosphere . SO2 is mostly emitted into the atmosphere through the burning of fossil fuels but can also be derived through some industrial processes like extracting metal from ore , operating vehicles and heavy equipment that burn high-sulfur content fuels , and through some natural sources like volcanoes . Exposure to SO2 can negatively impact the respiratory system in humans . High SO2 concentrations can also lead to the formation of other sulfur oxides which contribute to particulate matter pollution . Environmentally , SO2 can contribute to acid rain and can also damage the growth of plants .
