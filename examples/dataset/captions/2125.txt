Employment and labor force in China â€“ additional information According to the graph at hand , absolute unemployment in China has gradually risen over the past decade . Although this increase suggests rising unemployment levels , a glance at the unemployment rate in China shows that national unemployment levels have remained stable at around four percent in recent years and even saw a slight decline from 4.3 percent to 4.1 percent in 2010 , as the national labor force in China simultaneously had shown continuous growth . Nevertheless , due to the continuing demographic shift towards urban areas and coastal provinces as well as disadvantageous location factors , especially central and western regions in China face above average unemployment levels among their population . Among those regions , Hunan , Sichuan and Shandong displayed the highest number of unemployed people . As of 2017 , Sichuan ranked first with over half a million unemployed people . It is also worth nothing , that the structure of youth unemployment in China has its own character . Those who are less educated were far less likely to be unemployed than those who were better educated . As of 2011 , approximately 16 percent of Bachelor graduates had been registered as unemployed , whereas merely four percent of young people primary school education or lower did not have a regular job .
