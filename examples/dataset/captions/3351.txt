Twenty years later , circulation figures amounted to less than 19 million copies . German daily newspaper circulation has been declining steadily during the evaluation period . As of 2019 , the number of copies sold amounted to 13.5 million - a steep drop compared to the figures from 1991 . Several key factors contribute to these developments include the expansion and rapid advancement of online news media , with consumers switching to finding the information they search for online instead of in print , as well as rising mobility and the desire to use media and read news on the go . Last but not least , the continuing rapid development and use of mobile devices such as tablets or mobile phones also changes news media preferences among consumers , particularly in regard to print media , and among these , daily newspapers .
