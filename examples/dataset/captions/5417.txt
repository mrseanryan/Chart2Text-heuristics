Temperature anomalies provide the difference from an average or baseline temperature . Positive anomalies show that the observed temperature was warmer than the baseline , whereas a negative anomaly indicates that the observed temperature was lower than baseline . Since the 1980s , annual temperature departure from the 20th century has been consistently positive . In 2019 , the land and ocean surface temperature anomaly stood at 0.95 Celsius . Temperature anomalies are generally more important in the study of climate change than absolute temperature . This is because when calculating average absolute temperatures , factors like station location and elevation may have critical impacts on absolute temperatures , but be less significant in anomaly calculations . A warming planet The past years were the warmest years on record , where warming was driven largely by increased emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere . Climate change is also evident in the warming ocean surface temperatures as well as the extent of sea ice in the Northern Hemisphere , which usually reaches its peak in December . Weather dynamics can affect regional temperatures and thus , the level of warming can vary around the world . For example , warming trends are most obvious in the Arctic region with the continued loss of sea ice .
