Total visits to Smithsonian museums and institutions dropped slightly in 2018 to 28.5 million , down from 30 million in the previous year . What is the Smithsonian ? The Smithsonian is a group of museums and research centers run by the U.S. Government and mostly based in the District of Columbia . Public entry to all Smithsonian museums is free , with funds being provided through federal budget appropriations and donations . In 2018 the National Air and Space Museum was the most visited of the Smithsonian institutions , attracting 6.3 million visitors in 2018 . Museums in the U.S. and globally The Smithsonian is by far the largest not-for-profit cultural institution in United States , receiving over three times the revenue of the next largest , the Metropolitan Museum of Art . The comparison is perhaps a little misleading though , given that the Smithsonian is a group of institutions . If assessed in terms of a single institution , the Metropolitan Museum of Art has higher visitor numbers and any single Smithsonian museum , and in 2018 was the third-most visited art museum in the world .
