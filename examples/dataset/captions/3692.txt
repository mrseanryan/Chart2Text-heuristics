Scotland has seen its annual rainfall vary since 1994 , but it usually received more than 1,500 millimeters ( mm ) of rain per year . However , in 2018 the recorded rainfall amounted to 1,395mm , which was the fourth lowest during this period . Rainfall peaked in 2011 at 1,886mm . As of 2019 , rainfall reached 1,593mn Wet end to the year The wettest months in Scotland tend to be those at the end of each year , with December of 2015 recording higher than normal levels of rain at 328mm . That same month there was an average of 25.7 raindays . Raindays are defined as those where more than 1mm of rain falls . This was approximately 10 more days of rainfall compared to December 2018 . Why is it so wet in Scotland ? With its mountainous landscape , it is no coincidence that on average it is Scotland that receives the most annual rain in the UK . The wettest parts of the UK are generally in mountainous regions , with the Western Highlands prone to high levels of rain . Here , rainfall can be 3,000mm per year . However , the East of Scotland can see levels as low as 800mm . This is often due to rainfall from the Atlantic weather systems coming in from the West and as these systems move east , rain deposits reduce .
