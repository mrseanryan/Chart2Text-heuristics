Does it always rain in Belgium ? Well , there is some truth in each stereotype ! Although it certainly does not rain every day , there is a lot of rainfall in Belgium . In 2016 , it rained 190 out of 366 days , or over half of the days . And this was by no means a record : in 2012 , it rained 212 days , or nearly 60 percent of all days . That year , the rainfall was nearly 1,000 millimeters . In 2016 , although there were fewer rain days , rainfall was still over 940 millimeters . Fortunately the sun sometimes shines too Having read this , one might be forgiven for thinking the climate in Belgium is rather bad . Fortunately , Belgians have ample time to enjoy the sun as well . In 2016 for example , there were nearly 1,600 hours of sunshine . This was significantly more than in 2007 and 2008 for instance , when there were less than 1,500 hours . In recent years , 2011 was the sunniest year , with almost 1,800 hours of sunshine . Average temperature around 10 degrees Celsius All year round , the average temperature in Belgium is around 10 degrees Celsius in the last decade . In 2016 , the average reached 10.7 degrees , a slight decrease compared to the two previous years , when the average temperature was 11.9 ( 2014 ) and 11.3 ( 2015 ) respectively .
