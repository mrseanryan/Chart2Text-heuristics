The statistic shows the GDP per capita in France from 1984 to 2018 , with projections up until 2024 . In 2018 , GDP per capita in France was at around 42,953.27 US dollars.Suffering competitiveness GDP is one of the primary indicators that is used to gauge the state of health of a country 's economy . It is the total market value of all completed goods and services that have been produced within a country in a given period of time , usually a year . GDP figures allow us to understand a country 's economy in a clear way . Real GDP , in a similar way , is also a very useful indicator ; this is a measurement that takes prices changes ( inflation and deflation ) into account , therefore acting as a key indicator for economic growth . Gross domestic product per capita in France is predicted to continue falling in 2013 after a short period of growth in 2011 indicated that it may not , in fact , be on the mend . The country has been suffering significant economic hardship since the economic crisis of 2008 swept across the world . The European Union 's second largest economy is experiencing a shocking deterioration in its level of competitiveness . The items – cars , clothing , steel , electrical goods – that France is producing are simply failing to compete with the goods produced by Asian countries and its European neighbours , which , in turn , is leading to an accelerating fall in exports and a notable decline in the service and manufacturing sectors that support them . It could be argued that up until now France has managed to maintain its status as a reliable northern eurozone country , propped up by the uncontested reliability and strength of its principal partner , Germany .
