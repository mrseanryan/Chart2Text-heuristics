The graph shows the population distribution in China in 2019 , by broad age group . In 2019 , about 64.0 percent of the population was between 16 and 59 years old . Apart from the information given on broad age groups in this statistic , some more information is provided by a timeline for the age distribution and a population breakdown by smaller age groups . Demographic development in China â€“ additional information China ranked as the most populous country in the world as of 2014 with a population of more than 1.36 billion , followed closely by India with roughly 1.3 billion inhabitants . As the world population reached around 7.24 billion in mid 2014 , China represented almost one fifth of the global population . China 's population increased exponentially between the 1950s and the early 1980s due to Mao Zedong 's population policy . To tackle the problem of overpopulation , a one-child policy was implemented in 1979 . Since then , China 's population growth has slowed from more than two percent per annum in the 1970s to around 0.5 percent per annum in the 2000s . One outcome of the strict population policy is the acceleration of demographic aging trends . According to the United Nations , China 's population median age had risen by 84 percent over the last four decades , from 19.4 years in 1970 to 34.6 years in 2010 . Few countries have aged faster than China . The dramatic ageing of the population is matched by slower growth . The total fertility rate , measuring the number of children a woman can expect to have in her life , stood at just 1.66 children . This incremental decline in labor force could lead to future challenges for the Chinese government , causing instability in current health care and social insurance mechanisms .
