This statistic shows the population of the Netherlands in 2019 , by age . On January 1 , 2019 there were approximately 3.8 million people younger than 20 years living in the Netherlands . The largest age group was formed by those between 40 and 65 years old . Together , they number nearly six million people . The retired population of the Netherlands consists of approximately three million people . Considering this make-up of Dutch society , it is not surprising there are so many debates around increasing the retirement age . The ratio of the non-working population to the working population has decreased between 1950 and today , as this statistic shows . A recent forecast however indicates that this ratio might not decrease much further in the next 40 years , meaning the number of working people to support the non-working people will more or less remain stable .
