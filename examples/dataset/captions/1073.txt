The number of members of the National Association of Realtors ( NAR ) has steadily increased since 2012 , reaching a membership of 1.4 million in 2019 , an all-time high . This trend also reflects the recovery of the property market after the financial crisis of 2007 - 2009 , as the volume of home sales began to climb from 2011 . The NAR is a North American trade association for real estate workers formed in 1908 and currently based in Chicago , Illinois . Employment in the real estate sector The upward in NRA membership is mirrored in overall employment in the real estate sector in the United States . In 2016 , 1.6 million people were employed in the sector , which indicates that the majority of workers are member of the NAR . Employment in the sector is set to increase in firms with less than 2,500 employees until 2026 . Larger firms – those with 2,500 employees or more – are forecast to decrease the number of employees in the near future . Membership growth ties in with growth in home sales The growth in NAR membership also correlates with the growth of residential property sales . For instance , the number of new houses sold in the U.S. has been on the rise since 2011 . American adults as a whole have been steady in their view that home ownership is an important part of the American Dream . However , the share of American Millennials – those born between 1981 and 1996 - who view homeownership as important has been fluctuating since 2010 . This adds an element of uncertainty to the future of the housing market , because Millennials are in their mid-twenties and thirties , which is widely viewed as the best time to buy a home from a home equity perspective .
