This statistic presents the cost of Spotify 's royalty fees and distribution costs payable to music artists and license holders from 2012 to 2015 . In the most recently reported year , the streaming platform paid out 1.62 billion euros in royalty fees . Further information With more than 100 million monthly active users worldwide , Spotify is one of the most popular music streaming platforms . Founded in Sweden in 2006 , the service was available in 59 countries as of February 2016 . As of the same period , Spotify had a brand awareness of 52 percent in the United States , ranking behind local competitors Pandora , Apple Music and iHeartRadio .

Spotify generates the majority of its revenues via subscriptions â€“ in 2015 , subscription revenues amounted to 1.74 billion euros , representing a 78 percent growth from the previous year . In March 2016 , Spotify reported having 30 million paying users . Despite all of this , the company has yet to report a profit , as the most recently reported net loss amounted to over 173 million euros . Like YouTube , the company has a contentious relationship with the music industry . Critics argue that artists and music rights holders are not compensated adequately for their music streams . In 2015 , digital music accounted for 6.7 billion U.S. dollars of recorded music market revenues worldwide , surpassing traditional music sales and arguably reviving music sales overall . Nonetheless , streaming experts find that the compensation of artists via digital royalty fees is still lacking when compared with streaming platform revenues and the number of streams .
