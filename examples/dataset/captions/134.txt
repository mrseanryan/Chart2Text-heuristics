While the standard image of the nuclear family with two parents and 2.5 children has persisted in the American imagination , the number of births in the U.S. has steadily been decreasing since 1990 , with about 3.79 million babies born in 2018 . In 1990 , this figure was 4.16 million . Birth and replacement rates A country 's birth rate is defined as the number of live births per 1,000 inhabitants , and it is this particularly important number that has been decreasing over the past few decades . The declining birth rate is not solely an American problem , with EU member states showing comparable rates to the U.S. Additionally , each country has what is called a `` replacement rate . '' The replacement rate is the rate of fertility needed to keep a population stable when compared with the death rate . In the U.S. , the fertility rate needed to keep the population stable is around 2.1 children per woman , but this figure was at 1.77 in 2017 . Falling birth rates Currently , there is much discussion as to what exactly is causing the birth rate to decrease in the United States . There seem to be several factors in play , including longer life expectancies , financial concerns ( such as the economic crisis of 2008 ) , and an increased focus on careers , all of which are causing people to wait longer to start a family . How international governments will handle falling populations remains to be seen , but what is clear is that the declining birth rate is a multifaceted problem without an easy solution .
