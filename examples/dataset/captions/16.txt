The consumer price index is a measure of change in the price level of a preselected market basket of consumer goods and services purchased by households . This forecast of U.S. inflation was prepared by the International Monetary Fund . They project roughly a 2.25 percent annual rise in the general level of prices until 2024 . This means that a product bought today for about 100 U.S. dollars will cost about 102.25 U.S. dollars next year , and so on .

Although the moderate inflation of prices between 2 and 3 percent is considered normal in a modern economy , countries ' central banks try to prevent severe inflation and deflation to keep the growth of prices to a minimum . Severe inflation is considered dangerous to a country 's economy because it can rapidly diminish the population 's purchasing power and thus damage the GDP .
