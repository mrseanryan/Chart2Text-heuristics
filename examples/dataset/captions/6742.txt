Structures of Italian families Nationwide , 35 percent of the households consisted of families without a nucleus , such as people living alone , families consisting of e.g . two sisters , or a parent living with a child who is separated , widowed or divorced , etcetera . Furthermore , couples with children made up 32 percent of all households in Italy , representing the second most common household structure . While the average size of families experienced a decrease , one/single person households were on the rise . In 2018 , there were 8.5 million single-person households in Italy , about one million more than in 2012 . More babies in the South Considering the birth rate in the Italian regions could be useful to better understand the size of the households .

In 2018 , the Southern regions recorded a birth rate of 7.6 babies per every one thousand inhabitants . Similarly , on the Islands , there were 7.5 births per every thousand residents . However , on a national scale the births dropped constantly in the last years . In 2018 , 7.3 children were born per one thousand inhabitants , about two infants less than in 2002 .
