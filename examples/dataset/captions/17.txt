The New York Yankees are one of the most recognisable and valuable sports brands on the planet , no doubt in part due to their success on the baseball field . The New York franchise has won the World Series championships a record 27 times , with their closest rivals in terms of titles , the St. Louis Cardinals , having lifted the trophy 11 times . However , the Yankees fans have been starved of success in recent years as the team 's last World Series title came back in 2009 . MLB World Series Baseball in North America has a long history , dating back at least to the 1850s , when it was already referred to as the national game or national pastime . In the late 1800s , the National Association of Base Ball Players , the sport 's first governing body , was formed in the New York area . Today , Major League Baseball ( MLB ) is the governing body of professional baseball in the United States and Canada , uniting two leagues â€” the American League ( AL ) and the National League ( AL ) , each with 15 teams and three divisions . Every October , the winners of each league championship series meet in order to play the MLB World Series , the most important event of the baseball season . New York Yankees The Yankees , who play in the American League East , were established in 1901 under the name The Orioles in Baltimore and were rebranded in 1913 in New York . The New York Yankees are the most valuable franchise in Major League Baseball . As of 2019 , the team 's brand value is estimated at some 4.6 billion U.S. dollars , far ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in second place with a value of 3.3 billion U.S. dollars . The Yankees play their homes games at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx area of New York City . The stadium has a capacity of just over 47 thousand for baseball games and the average attendance for a Yankees game during the 2018 season stood at just under 43 thousand . As a result , a total of almost 3.5 million spectators passed through the gates of Yankee Stadium across the season , a decrease from the 4.27 million fans who enjoyed the games live during the 2007 season .
