Internet freedom Indonesia was listed as `` partly free '' in the Freedom on the Net index , which places the country ahead of less free Asian online markets such as China , Thailand or Malaysia but behind Japan , South Korea and the Philippines . This rating is due to blocked political and social content as well as various restrictions and violations of user rights , most notably through the governmental passing of the Law on Information and Electronic Transactions ( ITE Law ) . The ITE law holds strong penalties such as prison sentences and high fines for anybody convicted of online defamation charges . This law has also been applied to blog posts and Facebook comments and has lead to self-censorship among online writers and internet users as well as an increasingly tense online atmosphere .
