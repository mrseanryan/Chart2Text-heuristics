In the period of consideration , the total monthly hours of sunlight in the UK followed a similar pattern each year . The most notable change occurred in 2018 , when the hours of sunlight shot up in May , June and July to 246 , 240 and 238 hours respectively . Unsurprisingly it was the end of each year when sunlight hours were lowest . Little sunshine throughout the day The average annual number of daily sun hours has seen little change since the turn of the century , with the lowest average number being recorded in 2012 at 4 hours and the highest average being 4.9 in 2003 . Instruments such as the Campbell-Stokes sunshine recorder are used to measure sunshine duration . However , more modern equipment is now being used as the Campbell-Stokes recorder overestimates sunshine duration . England gets the most sunshine Although sunshine is not a common sight throughout the United Kingdom , on average England receives the most monthly hours . Since 2014 , the longest monthly duration of sunlight was recorded in June 2018 , at an average of 248.5 hours . In comparison , Scotland received just 220 hours of sunshine in the same month .
