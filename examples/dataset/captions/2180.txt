This statistic shows the results of an opinion poll conducted in 2015 asking Americans to describe Donald Trump in one word . In 2015 , 9.8 percent of Americans chose the words `` idiot/jerk/stupid/dumb '' to describe Donald Trump , 6 percent chose `` arrogant '' and 5.6 percent chose `` crazy/nuts '' . Trump 's perception as a presidential candidate In 2015 , when Americans who were asked to describe Donald Trump in one word , close to 10 percent of Americans chose the words `` idiot/jerk/stupid/dumb '' . Other words that were used include arrogant , crazy , nuts , buffoon , clown , joke , unfavorable , egotistical , narcissist , bombastic , entertaining , untrustworthy and aggressive . Of course there were also a few positive words used to describe him , but interestingly , the majority of chosen terms was negatively connotated . At the start of 2016 , the Huffington post chose other words to describe him when they began using this disclaimer : `` Donald Trump is a serial liar , rampant xenophobe , racist , birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S. '' Yet , it is exactly these characteristics which have helped him get significant attention , and which have brought to light some important underlying issues that have been churning in American society . For instance , Trump has spent less than other candidate throughout his campaign . Also , back in 2014 , before Trump entered the race as a serious contender , the most important problems facing the United States were defined as dissatisfaction with government , the economy in general and immigration/illegal aliens . Trump has addressed all three . In 2016 , terrorism , gun control , and racism have also gained importance . Apparently it does n't matter if Trump is perceived as an idiot or a racist , these characteristics do not seem to be hindering his campaign .
