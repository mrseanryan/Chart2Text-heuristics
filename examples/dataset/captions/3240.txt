The statistic shows gross domestic product ( GDP ) in Peru from 1984 to 2018 , with projections up until 2024 . Gross domestic product ( GDP ) denotes the aggregate value of all services and goods produced within a country in any given year . GDP is an important indicator of a country 's economic power . In 2018 , Peru 's gross domestic product amounted to around 225.37 billion U.S. dollars . Dropping mineral prices affect Peru 's economy The economy of Peru is still strong and the prospect of significant future growth still remains , but overall GDP appears to be waning after a period of significant growth which took place between 2010 and 2013 . The annual growth rate of Peruvian GDP was as high as 8.45 percent in 2010 . Yet , the annual growth rate for 2014 was only a quarter of that , and future growth rates are expected to linger at around 4 percent . Much of this earlier growth can be attributed to the country 's mineral wealth in copper , silver , lead , zinc , oil and gold , but over the years , the price of many of these minerals has been on a decline . The price of many of these mineral resources began to decline in 2011 , some decreasing significantly in price and others less so . The copper price has decreased , as has the price of lead and gold . The price of silver dropped significantly , too , and the impact of falling oil prices is being felt around the world . Zinc is the only aforementioned mineral whose price has remained stable . As the economy of Peru is directly linked to these resources and industry composes close to a 40 percent share of GDP , it is no wonder the economy of Peru has been impacted .
