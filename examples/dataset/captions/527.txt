While they may not have made it out of the group stages of the 2018 World Cup , the Serbian national team were top of the table when it came to the average height of their players – their squad boasted an average height of 185.6 centimeters per player . The first-choice goalkeeper for Serbia , Vladimir Stojković , was one of the tallest members of the team at 195 centimeters . At the other end of the scale , the squad of Saudi Arabia came in at an average of just 176.2 centimeters , making them the shortest squad at the 2018 World Cup . Youth vs. ExperienceThe oldest squad at the 2018 World Cup belonged to Costa Rica . Their squad had an average age of 29.6 years , almost four years older than the squad of Nigeria , who had the youngest squad at the tournament . However , neither youth nor experience triumphed in this instance as both teams failed to get out of their groups . Indeed , the result of the World Cup , with France emerging victorious after beating Croatia in the final , went very much to form . The France squad was the most expensive squad at the tournament , with a combined market value of 1.08 billion euros . Panama 's squad , on the other hand , had a combined transfer value of just 9.13 million euros . Homegrown talents The Premier League is often called the best league in the world , so it is unsurprising that the entire England squad at the World Cup plied their trade in the English top division . In contrast , there were three national squads in which all of the players played their domestic football abroad – none of the players in the squads of Croatia , Sweden , or Iceland played their club football on home soil . Manchester City was the most represented club team at the World Cup in 2018 , with 16 of its players participating . Real Madrid came a close second with 15 members of the squad taking part in the tournament .
