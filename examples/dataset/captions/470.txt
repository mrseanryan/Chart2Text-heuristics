Internet billionaires Millions of entrepreneurs are hoping that their company will be the next big thing , and for many startups going public or being acquired by an industry giant are a safe bet to generate riches . The ranking of the richest internet billionaires is dominated by founders and early investors of global online companies including Amazon , Google and Facebook , or startups that were sold to major companies . A popular example of a successful sales is mobile messaging app WhatsApp , which was sold to Facebook in 2014 for an eyewatering 19 billion U.S. dollars , making founders Jan Koum and Brian Acton billionaires in the process . However , as of 2019 , Facebook is no longer a desired acquirer for young tech companies , as the social network is plagued by a series of scandals and many founders of its former acquisitions have spoken out against Facebook . WhatsApp 's and Instagram 's founders left the company , and the Oculus founders were demoted . Many acquired products have also been shut down , making it an unattractive prospect to sell an innovative service to Facebook . Facebook founder Zuckerberg has stated in 2010 that most of his company 's acquisition efforts are for the talent , not for the product . Billionaires in China The flourishing Chinese tech market , led by online giants BAT ( Baidu , Alibaba , Tencent ) , has given rise to a whole new group of self-made billionaires . The richest newcomer on the tech billionaire ranking is Colin Huang , founder of Chinese discount web retailer Pinduoduo , which went public in the United States in July 2018 , raising 1.6 billion US . dollars in the process .
