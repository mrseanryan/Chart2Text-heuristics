weden 's gross domestic product declined between 2008 and 2009 , and then increased annually until 2018 . The dip in 2009 was caused by the financial crisis in 2008 . The decline in growth rate was 5.2 percent , compared to the previous year , which was the largest fall in the GDP growth rate in Sweden since the Second World War . Household consumption affects the GDP There are many factors affecting the gross domestic product of a country , and the household consumption is one important factor . The household consumption is regulated by the level of employment in the country , and the economics of the households . During the period from 2011 to 2017 , both the level of employment and the annual household disposable income increased , which in turn generated a higher household consumption . Export of goods Another important factor influencing Sweden 's GDP is the export of services and goods . The export of services increased quicker than the exports of goods for several years , but the export of goods are still larger than the export of services . The commodity with the largest exported value in 2017 was machinery and transport equipment , which was valued at around 528 billion Swedish kronor .
