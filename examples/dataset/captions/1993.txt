Debt-to-GDP ratio â€“ additional information In economics , the ratio between a country 's government debt and its gross domestic product ( GDP ) is generally defined as the debt-to-GDP ratio . It is a useful indicator for investors to measure a country 's ability to fulfill future payments on its debts . A low debt-to-GDP ratio also suggests that an economy produces and sells a sufficient amount of goods and services to pay back those debts . Among the important industrial and emerging countries , Japan displayed one of the highest debt-to-GDP ratios . In 2017 , the estimated national debt of Japan amounted to about 236 percent of its GDP , up from around 180 percent in 2004 . One reason behind Japan 's high debt load lies in its low annual growth rate . China 's national debt related to GDP surged from around 18 percent in 2009 to 34 percent in 2010 . After the 2008 financial crisis , China had relied heavily on credit financing to spur economic growth . The rapid increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio during that time had been mainly due to the four trillion yuan stimulus plan to invest in infrastructure projects .
