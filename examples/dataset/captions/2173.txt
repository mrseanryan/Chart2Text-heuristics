Between January 1 and December 31 , 2019 , aerospace manufacturer Boeing had received gross orders for 113 Boeing 787 jets . Twenty orders belonged to German airliner Lufthansa , one of the largest commercial airline companies in Europe . Lufthansa was also a launch customer of 747 - 8 and 737 jets and will be among the first customers of the 777X . China has become a large market for the Dreamliner CALC Aircraft Assets Limited of China placed two orders for the 787 in 2019 . That year , Boeing 's 100th delivery of a 787 aircraft in China underpinned the jet 's popularity with Chinese customers : Juneyao received its sixth Dreamliner delivery in November 2019 . The first 787 entered China in 2013 , according to Boeing . The U.S. aircraft manufacturing industry is largely dependent on exports to China , and hence Boeing is expected to benefit from a partial trade agreement between Washington and Beijing . The agreement was formalized in January 2020 . Profitability remains in question A new Boeing 787 Dreamliner in 2019 would set customers like Emirates , Lufthansa , or Korean Air back between 248 and 338 million U.S. dollars , depending on the specifications . The 787 program had aimed to produce aircraft very cost efficiently but , by 2011 , the program had cost 32 billion U.S. dollars , and it would take 1,100 sales of the aircraft to break even . Some 859 units of the long-range , mid-size wide-body jet airliner have been delivered by September 2019 . The fact that there have been many technical difficulties with the 787 Dreamliner has hit Boeing substantially . Pre-launch setbacks delayed the release of the aircraft and post-launch issues have even led to the grounding of the Dreamliner fleet . In 2013 , all 787 flights were halted due to electrical problems related to battery fires . As a result , many airline companies have charged Boeing for loss of business from the failures of the 787 . The long-term profitability of the 787 program remains in question . Additionally , the grounding and delayed production of the 737-MAX has also hit Boeing 's earnings .
