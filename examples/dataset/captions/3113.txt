Japan was the only other country with over a trillion U.S. dollars in reserves , with a total of 1.38 trillion U.S. dollars . Why do countries hold reserves ? A simple explanation for China 's accumulation of foreign currency could be its consistently positive and substantial trade balance . When China exports goods and services , it accepts the foreign currency , usually U.S. dollars , and holds that currency in reserve . In addition to facilitating trade , most countries , including China , also hold foreign exchange reserves to ensure the stability of their currencies and facilitate other foreign transactions .
