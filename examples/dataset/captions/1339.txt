The population in Malaysia grew to 32.4 million people in 2018 . This is in line with a steady positive trend that has been happening since at least 2014 and is forecast to continue until at least 2024 , as well as with the growth rates in other ASEAN countries . Malaysian demographics As the fertility rate slowly declines , the population growth rate should slowly decline as well . However , since life expectancy is also slowly increasing , this can still fuel population growth , as we see in this statistic . In Malaysia , this is leading to a healthy age structure , with a large group of working-age people who are able to support a smaller number of old and young people . Economic effects A growing population should lead to an increasing gross domestic product ( GDP ) , simply because more people means more consumers and workers . This is especially effective if the country is at full employment . Given the generally low level of unemployment in Malaysia , it is fairly safe to assume that this is true .
