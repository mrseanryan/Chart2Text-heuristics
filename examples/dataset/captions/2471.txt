This statistic represents major countries at the end of year 2018 , by cumulative solar PV capacity . China 's cumulative solar PV ( photovoltaic ) capacity reached 176.1 gigawatts at the end of 2018 . Solar photovoltaic - additional information With the assistance of politically-driven subsidies , the solar photovoltaic ( PV ) sector continues to attract investors , with investment volumes that eclipse the deals made in other markets , including the wind power and biomass energy sectors . Although the electricity derived from solar sources is much less reliable than power from nuclear fission or coal combustion , solar power has become a force in the energy market . Global cumulative installed solar PV capacity amounted to around 509.3 gigawatts in 2018 , up from less than 2.6 gigawatts in 2003 . China , Japan , Germany and the United States are the most important markets for solar photovoltaic installations . The process to convert solar radiation into direct current electricity requires the use of inverters and solar photovoltaic modules . Such modules consist of a number of solar cells which are usually made from semiconductor materials such as silicon . The most widely used materials to produce solar cells include multicrystalline ( also called polycrystalline ) silicon or monocrystalline ( also called single-crystal ) silicon . As a result of policy instruments such as punitive tariffs , subsidies and tax cuts , the prices of solar modules began to fall in 2002 and its decline is expected to continue into the future as PV technology advances . While production of solar cells is increasingly shifting towards Asian markets , lower costs will likely drive innovation in the field of solar cell technology and make solar PV power more affordable .
