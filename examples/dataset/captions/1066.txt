The median age in Vietnam was 30.5 years in 2015 , meaning that half the population was younger than this at the time , and half older . This figure has increased since its low point in 1970 , which was likely due to the Vietnam War . The median age is expected to increase to 41 years by 2050 . Age structure The age structure in Vietnam changes slowly as people get older . This suggests that other demographic indicators are also slow to evolve , which in turn points to stability . This fact is convenient for policy makers , who can then rely on a consistent ratio of pensioners and students to workers . This is helpful in taxation and allocation of government spending . However , it also points to slow inprovement in indicators such as life expectancy . Economic implications Given Vietnam 's Communist government , it is not surprising that a large portion of its gross domestic product ( GDP ) comes from government expenditures . As such , the country needs a broad tax base . Since people 's earning potential rises with age until they retire , a relatively high median age is necessary to bear this tax burden . A low unemployment rate further bolsters this effect . This implies that the current demographic situation in Vietnam is sustainable .
