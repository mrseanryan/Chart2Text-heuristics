Similar to the years before , U.S. company AbbVie 's Humira maintained its place as the global top ranked drug based on revenue . During 2018 , Humira generated a huge 20 billion U.S. dollars in revenue , another significant increase from 18.4 billion dollars the year before . The second ranked drug Eliquis , marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer , made less than half of Humira 's revenue . Celgene 's Revlimid completed the top ranked three pharmaceutical products worldwide . Top drug Humira Humira is used mostly for the treatment of rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis . However , like many other top drugs , the range of medical conditions it can be used to treat is much larger . Thus , the drug is also used to treat Crohn 's disease , ankylosing spondylitis , ulcerative colitis , psoriasis , uveitis , and some other autoimmune diseases . Humira is administered subcutaneously via injection . It was approved for the first time in 2002 in the United States . Blockbuster drug reliance Blockbuster drugs often have a large impact on the manufacturer . In some cases , pharmaceutical companies are highly dependent on their sales performance . In the case of Humira , AbbVie generates over 60 percent of its total revenue from this drug and almost 80 percent from its top 3 products . Companies that depend on a small number of blockbuster drugs could be under threat of heavy revenue loss . Biosimilars of Humira ( adalimumab ) are already available and will take more and more of the market in the years to come . Thus , it is not expected that Humira will exceed the 20 billion-dollar-revenue mark but will more likely suffer from a distinct revenue decrease until 2024 .
