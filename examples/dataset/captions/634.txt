The statistic shows the inflation rate in Japan from 1984 to 2018 , with projections up until 2024 . The inflation rate is calculated using the price increase of a defined product basket . This product basket contains products and services , on which the average consumer spends money throughout the year . They include expenses for groceries , clothes , rent , power , telecommunications , recreational activities and raw materials ( e.g . gas , oil ) , as well as federal fees and taxes . In 2018 , the inflation rate in Japan was about 0.98 percent compared to the previous year . Economy of Japan Among the countries with the largest gross domestic product / GDP , Japan is only outranked by the United States and China , making it the third-largest economy in the world . Apart from a few significant slumps in growth now and then , Japan 's gross domestic product has been stable for the past decade , and is mostly yielded by the services sector . Industry accounts for about 30 percent of Japan 's GDP ; while a smaller contribution of 1.3 percent is generated by the agricultural sector . This is reflected in the economic sector distribution of the workforce in Japan ; the majority of Japan 's workers are employed in services . Japan 's inflation rate , which can be seen above , is actually among the lowest worldwide . The country 's national debt in relation to GDP has reached dramatic levels over the years , and the budget balance in Japan in relation to gross domestic product / GDP has ran at a deficit at about 10 percent of GDP for the past few years . As for trade , Japan is among the leading export countries worldwide , and the leading import countries worldwide . Japan 's main export and import partners are China and the United States . Among other goods , the country exports mainly electronics , transportation equipment and vehicles , while imports mostly consist of fossil fuels , food and textiles . This , however , does not mean that Japan 's economy is recovering anytime soon - its trade balance has been showing a steadily increasing deficit for the past few years as well .
