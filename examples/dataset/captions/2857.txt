The circulation of the men 's lifestyle and entertainment magazine Playboy has dropped significantly in recent years , falling to just over 200 thousand in 2018 from 1.2 million five years earlier . The magazine reported its highest global circulation in 1975 , when an average issue sold 5.6 million copies . Playboy circulation numbers â€“ additional information Founded in 1953 by the late Hugh Hefner , Playboy is a men 's lifestyle and entertainment magazine . Playboy started in Chicago , and is now published in more than 50 countries . The first foreign edition was launched in Germany in 1972 . In 2018 , Playboy magazine reached around 740 thousand readers per issue in Germany . The magazine 's logo , which is a silhouette of a rabbit in a tuxedo bow tie , is one of the most recognizable trademarks in the world . Thanks to its strong brand and reputation over the years , Playboy frequently used to feature in a ranking of leading magazines on social media , however the publication 's dwindling popularity saw the brand drop off the list . As of March 2016 , about 16.82 million people liked Playboy 's page on Facebook , and had 4.6 million Instagram followers , but since then has been overtaken by Vogue , GQ and Vanity Fair amongst others . Cooper Hefner ( son of Hugh Hefner ) has made multiple attempts to redefine , rebrand and restyle the publication during his time as chief creative officer , including removing nudity from the magazine and then deciding to include it again shortly afterwards . Despite his efforts , it seems unlikely that Playboy will ever successfully regain the influence or popularity it enjoyed in the 1970s , however the brand itself will likely live on in consumer 's memories young and old for many years to come .
