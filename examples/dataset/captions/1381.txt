In recent years the number of nail salons in the United States has been shrinking , with there being a total of 54,386 salons nation-wide in 2018 . This compares to 56,886 salons in 2017 and 69,738 salons in 2016 . Nail salons Nail salons are distinguished from general beauty salons in that they offer primarily nail care services , with gel-polish , manicures and pedicures being the most common services offered . Prices for these services generally range between 20 and 50 U.S. dollars â€“ much lower than for many other beauty treatments . Despite this low unit price the industry is capable of generating significant revenue , with over eight billion U.S. dollars being spent on nail care services in the U.S. every year since 2013 . Nail salon employment Sources differ in determining how many people are employed in the U.S nail care industry . On one count , using a broader definition of nail technician , the industry employed just over 395,000 people in 2018 . However , using a stricter definition of manicurists and pedicurists , another count puts this figure at just over 110,000 . Aside from the differing definitions used , this discrepancy is likely affected by : the decentralized nature of the industry , with many salons being small , independent businesses ; inconsistent registration requirements between different states ; and the nature of the workforce itself , which includes many recent immigrants , some of which are undocumented ( and therefore likely not reported as employees ) .
