Greece , while perhaps experiencing the largest economic drought out of all European countries , improved on its inflation rate . The situation within the country is slowly improving itself as a result of a recent bailout as well as economic stimulus packages issued by the European Union . Furthermore , the Greek government managed its revenues and expenses more competently in comparison to the prime of the global and the Greek financial crisis , with annual expenses only slightly exceeding yearly revenues .
