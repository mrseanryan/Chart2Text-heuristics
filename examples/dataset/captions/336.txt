The online gaming platform , Steam , was first released by the Valve Corporation in 2003 . What started off as a small platform for Valve to provide updates to its games has turned into the largest computer gaming platform in the world . As of September 2019 , Steam reached a peak of 14.15 million concurrent users . Not just a place for indie games In its very beginnings , Steam was a tiny platform that released only seven games in 2004 . By 2018 , this number stood at 9,050 , ranging from Goat Simulator to Grand Theft Auto V. Despite the extraordinary range of games available from tiny indie games to worldwide blockbusters , a handful of games command the most attention from gamers . PlayerUnknown 's Battlegrounds was the most popular Steam game in 2018 , having reached more than 3.2 million players in a single hour in its peak , almost four times the players of its closest competitor , DOTA 2 . Can Steam keep pace with its competitors ? Steam added approximately 62.76 million new users in 2017 , nearly 2.5 million more than in the previous year . However , it seems that all is not rosy with the gaming platform as its user retention rate has steadily fallen in recent years . With console giants , Xbox and PlayStation , continually producing hits and exclusives from the production line , can Steam keep up with the times ? Epic Games , the creator of the worldwide sensation , Fortnite , also wants to get a slice of the pie , after launching its Epic Games Store in December 2018 as a direct competitor to Steam . In the continually evolving gaming market , who will come out on top ?
