The majority of Japanese adhere to Shintoism , a traditional Japanese religion focusing on rituals and worship at shrines . In 2017 , around 70 percent of the total population of Japan participated in Shinto practices . Closely behind is Buddhism , with more than 69 percent of the population adhering to its practices . Most Japanese thus practice both religions . The original Shinto Shintoism adherents worship spirits or gods at shrines , often publicly , through rituals and traditions . Shintoism is deeply ingrained in the Japanese culture and way of life , but the number of followers has been decreasing over the past years , as has the number of Japanese who are adhering to any kind of religion . Tradition seems to have to make way for modern attitudes and choices – still the number of people who call themselves Shinto adherents is quite high , even if they do not actively practice it . Everything zen in Buddhism While Shintoism seems to become a thing of the past , the number of Buddhists , on the other hand , has been stable over the last decade , and if anything , has only slightly decreased . Japan is , in fact , among the countries with the largest Buddhist communities , right after China , of course , and Thailand . This might be due to Buddhism being able to adapt much easier to modern times and its adherents ' everyday lives , as well as a better PR machine – Buddhism is , after all , also quite popular in the Western world .
