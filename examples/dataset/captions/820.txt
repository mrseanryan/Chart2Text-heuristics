In 2018 , the infant mortality rate in India was at about 30 deaths per 1,000 live births , a significant decrease from previous years . Infant mortality as an indicator The infant mortality rate is the number of deaths of children under one year of age per 1,000 live births . This rate is an important key indicator for a country 's health and standard of living ; a low infant mortality rate indicates a high standard of healthcare . Causes of infant mortality include premature birth , sepsis or meningitis , sudden infant death syndrome , and pneumonia . Globally , the infant mortality rate has shrunk from 63 infant deaths per 1,000 live births to 27 since 1990 and is forecast to drop to 8 infant deaths per 1,000 live births by the year 2100 . India 's rural problem With 32 infant deaths per 1,000 live births , India is neither among the countries with the highest nor among those with the lowest infant mortality rate . Its decrease indicates an increase in medical care and hygiene , as well as a decrease in female infanticide . Increasing life expectancy at birth is another indicator that shows that the living conditions of the Indian population are improving . Still , India 's inhabitants predominantly live in rural areas , where standards of living as well as access to medical care and hygiene are traditionally lower and more complicated than in cities . Public health programs are thus put in place by the government to ensure further improvement .
