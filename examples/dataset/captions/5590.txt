Per capita carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) emissions in the United States reached an estimate of 15.5 metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2019 . The United States has forecast that a decrease in CO2 emissions will occur through 2050 , reaching 12.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per person . This forecast is driven by increasing consumption of natural gas due to lower cost and emissions with higher efficiency . Increased use of natural gas is expected to parallel the decline of coal , which has higher emissions and lower efficiency . Is it possible to decouple emissions from growth ? Globally , carbon dioxide emissions have increased over the last few decades . China and the United States have been two of the largest greenhouse gas emitters in recent years . The ability of these major emitting countries to decouple their greenhouse gas emissions from economic growth . Annual global emissions stabilized from 2014 to 2016 but rose again in 2017 . Shifting to a carbon free economy is technologically feasible because some of the most emission intensive sectors are only a minor part of the economy . Deployment of renewable technologies has rapidly decreased in cost and low-carbon technologies are continuously infiltrating global industries .
