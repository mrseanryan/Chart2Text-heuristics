After a peak in 2014 , foreign direct investment ( FDI ) in Africa from the United States dropped to 47.80 billion U.S. dollars in 2018 . Africa receives lower FDI inflows than any other region . What is FDI ? FDI is when investors from one country , in this case the United States , invest in firms that are based abroad . Often investors do this to earn higher returns due to a risk premium . They will seek markets where default risk is higher . If their investments mature , the returns are higher than they would be in a place with less risk . Effects of FDI The United States has higher FDI outflows than any other country , in large part because its economy is so large . In addition to seeking higher returns , some investors are interested in cultivating international relationships . This could be an effort to expand the consumer base , shore up supply chains , or for humanitarian or cultural reasons . For the receiving country , FDI means an increase in capital . For emerging markets , this can be critical . When the number of banks per country is low , capital access becomes difficult .
