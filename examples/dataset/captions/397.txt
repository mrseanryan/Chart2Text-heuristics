In 2018 , the average inflation rate in Egypt amounted to about 20.86 percent , a slight decrease compared to the previous year , when it peaked at 23.54 percent . Political unrest Egypt has been shaken by political unrest and turmoil for years now , and these events affect the economy as well . On January 25 , 2011 , Egyptians started protesting police brutality under then-president Hosni Mubarak , demanding an end to his reign . The protests were met with violence by armed forces , resulting in more unrest and looting . In the end , hundreds of Egyptians had lost their lives and over 6,000 were injured . After Mubarak 's subsequent resignation and the Muslim Brotherhood taking power in the country , Mohamed Morsi was elected President in 2012 . He also was overthrown a year later after protests and was imprisoned . The current President , Abdel Fattah es-Sisi , was involved in overthrowing Morsi and took office in June 2014 . Sisi introduced a number of economic reforms , but they did not succeed in stabilizing Egypt 's economy . Economic unrest 2017 saw the Egyptian inflation rate skyrocket from 10.2 percent in 2016 to more than double that at 23.5 percent . Ever since , inflation has recovered only slowly , although projections today see it levelling off below ten percent in the future . Around the same year , Egypt 's GDP dropped to below 240 billion U.S. dollars , a historical low . Unemployment , another key indicator , has steadily been between 12 to 13 percent - one reason for this is Egypt 's reliance on agriculture , which does not factor into the unemployment rate . National debt has also increased dramatically over the last few years . All in all , the times of economic unrest are not yet over .
