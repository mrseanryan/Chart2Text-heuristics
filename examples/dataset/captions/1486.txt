Facebook , the world 's most popular social network , has billions of monthly active users globally of which less than three million are in China . The reason why Facebook reaches only around four percent of the Chinese population is because it is blocked in mainland China ( excluding Hong Kong , Macau , and Taiwan ) along with many other foreign social media giants like YouTube , Instagram , Pinterest and Twitter . Why is Facebook banned in China ? The Chinese government has been blocking access to Facebook since July 2009 , when a series of anti-government riots appeared in the Xinjiang province . The activists reportedly used Facebook as their main communications channel . Chinese authorities have no control over foreign social networks and see them as a threat to social and political stability , hence a long list of foreign internet sites , Facebook among them , are no longer easily accessible in China . Some people , however , access blocked websites by connecting to a virtual private network ( VPN ) . What is the future of Facebook in China ? Facebook 's most recent attempt to make a comeback in July 2018 was immediately prevented by the Chinese authorities . It is unlikely that China will allow it for as long as Facebook refuses to store its data servers within the country 's borders . Besides , keeping foreign social media banned is economically beneficial for such Chinese social networks as WeChat , Sina Weibo and Youku Tudou . WeChat , the most popular Chinese social media platform and messaging app , seems to successfully fill the `` Facebook void '' for at least a billion monthly active users .
