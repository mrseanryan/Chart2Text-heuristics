Real Madrid are by far the most successful team in European Cup history , having taken home the prestigious trophy a total of 13 times . Los Blancos ' closest rivals in terms of titles are AC Milan , who have won the Champions League seven times , most recently in 2007 against Liverpool . Real Madrid 's European dominanceReal Madrid have dominated the Champions League in recent years and took home the trophy four out of five times between 2013 and 2018 . Their only failure came during the 2015 season when they were knocked out by Juventus in the semi-finals , with bitter rivals Barcelona ultimately lifting the trophy . Having won the trophy in 2018 , there were high hopes for the reigning champions in 2019 . However , the European giants were knocked out by underdogs , Ajax , in the quarter final stage of the competition , marking their earliest exit from Europe for nine years . The Champions League is big businessThe total revenue of the UEFA Champions League amounted to over 2.1 billion euros in the 2017/18 , a significant jump from the revenue of just under 1.1 billion euros in the 2009/10 season . With the club competition being one of the most popular in the world , the rights to broadcast the games are unsurprisingly worth a lot of money . In the 2017/18 season , the competition generated revenue of over 1.71 billion euros in broadcasting rights and a further 390 million euros in commercial rights . While soccer still has a long way to go to reach the popularity of traditional sports such as American Football and basketball in the United States , it appears that interest in the sport is starting to grow . A total of two million U.S. viewers tuned into the Champions League final in 2018 , an increase from 1.68 million in 2016 .
