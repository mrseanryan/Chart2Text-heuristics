The statistic represents the average length of outages for nuclear power plants in the United States between 1995 and 2019 . In 2019 , as of October 2019 , this figure stood at 32 outage days . US nuclear refueling outage days America 's electricity needs are met by a selection of energy carriers including coal , oil and natural gas , as well as nuclear fuel and renewable energy sources . Despite the wide variety of fuels that can be used , the country 's power generation structure consists primarily of coal and nuclear power to provide its citizens with an around-the-clock `` baseload '' supply of electricity â€“ this is what makes nuclear power an essential and crucial element of the U.S. power generation mix . In spring and fall , when demand for electricity is lowest , a limited number of nuclear reactors are shut down for refueling and maintenance . Since spent fuel rods are no longer useful in sustaining a nuclear reaction , nuclear units are required to dispose of some of the spent fuel rods and conduct other routine maintenance and repair activities . The level of outage days at operational nuclear power plants in the United States dramatically decreased in the 1990s , when plants reduced the number of refueling outage days from 81 in 1997 to 40 in 1999 . In 2018 , there were 34 refueling outage days at U.S. nuclear power plants , down from 46 in 2012 .
