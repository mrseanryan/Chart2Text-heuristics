In 2020 , the average age in Thailand is expected to reach 40.1 years , twenty years higher than in 1980 , when it began to rise after a steady decrease in prior years . Previously , from 1950 to 1975 , the average age hovered around 18 years . The increased average age corresponds with rising life expectancy globally , accelerating especially around the mid-twentieth century onward . In this century , the life expectancy in Thailand has increased by roughly 2.5 years since 2007 , reaching 75.5 in 2017 . The standard of living is increasing In Thailand , people ages 15 to 64 have consistently made up the majority of the population from 2007 to 2017 . In this time , the older population grew increased by about three percent , while the younger population shrunk at roughly the same rate . This indicates that many people within the middle age category are reaching 65 or older , and that the birth rate is simultaneously declining . Birth rates are declining Every year , families are having fewer children in Thailand , with a fertility rate of less than 1.5 children per women of childbearing age in 2017 . This is not necessarily a bad sign â€“ it points towards increasing healthcare and living standards . Another indicator for this is the decreasing infant mortality in Thailand , meaning more of the children born each year survive . Lower infant mortality also contributes to the calculations of a higher life expectancy , and thus affects the country 's median age .
