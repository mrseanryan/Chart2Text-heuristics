In 2019 , Washington , D.C. had the highest population density in the United States , with 11,570 people per square mile . As a whole , there were 93 residents per square mile in the U.S. , and Alaska was the state with the lowest population density , with 1.3 residents per square mile . The problem of population density Simply put , population density is the population of a country divided by the area of the country . While this can be an interesting measure of how many people live in a country and how large the country is , it does not account for the degree of urbanization , or the share of people who live in urban centers . For example , Russia is the largest country in the world and has a comparatively low population , so its population density is very low . However , much of the country is uninhabited , so cities in Russia are much more densely populated than the rest of the country . Urbanization in the United States While the United States is not very densely populated compared to other countries , its population density has increased significantly over the past few decades . The degree of urbanization has also increased , and well over half of the population lives in urban centers .
