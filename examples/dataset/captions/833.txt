In 2018 , the total population of Singapore was approximately 5.64 million inhabitants . Population growth in the country is slow and even dropped below one percent the same year . The youth is fadingSingapore 's population is getting older , with the age bracket of those aged 65 and older getting bigger every year . At the same time , both the share of the younger age brackets , the 0 - 14 year-olds and the 15 - 64 year-olds , are decreasing . The median age of the Singaporeans is increasing rapidly , from 34.1 years in the year 2000 to an estimated 42.4 by 2020 , with no slowdown in sight . The old are here to stay The majority of Singaporeans are between 25 and 60 years old . In the years to come , improving healthcare and one of the highest life expectancies at birth will see this majority shift to the elderly . Additionally , Singapore 's fertility rate - the average number of children born per woman of childbearing age - is the lowest worldwide and below the replacement rate , which means that Singapore 's population is not only getting older , but also smaller in numbers in the future . This trend could have economic consequences , like decreasing GDP growth and increasing old-age dependency .
