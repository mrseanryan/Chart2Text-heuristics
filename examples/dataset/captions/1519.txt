As one of the world 's most beloved sports , it comes as no surprise that major soccer leagues around the world attract spectators in their thousands . The German Bundesliga sat top of the pile in the 2018/19 season , with an average of over 43 thousand fans flocking to the stadiums to watch the live action every weeekend . Popularity of the Bundesliga The best attended soccer league in the world in 2018/19 was the German Bundesliga , with an average of consistently over 40 thousand fans watching each match live in the stadium . This average has risen consistently in recent years and is around 5,000 more than the average in the 2007/08 season . Within the league , Borussia Dortmund recorded the highest average attendance during the 2018/19 season at over 80,000 fans . MLS ca n't compete with the NFL The average attendance of the MLS in North America stood at just under 22 thousand in the 2018/19 season . These figures pale in comparison to the popularity of the National Football League - a total of 17.1 million fans watched NFL games live during the 2018 regular season , with the number consistently over 17 million for the last decade . During the 2018 regular season , the Dallas Cowboys had the highest average home attendance in the league , with an average of over 91,000 fans watching each home game . This figure is almost 14,000 more than the average attendance of the New York Giants , which is the second highest in the league . Although the Cowboys ' AT & T Stadium has an official capacity of 80,000 for football games , it is expandable to 105,000 with standing room . NBA lagging behind In contrast to the NFL , the average attendance of NBA games is still relatively low , with an average of 21,930 people watching each game live in the 2018/19 season . These figures can be attributed to the smaller size of basketball arenas , with the largest arena in the NBA , The United Center , home of the Chicago Bulls , having a capacity of just under 25,000 people . The Philadelphia 76ers were the best supported team throughout the whole of the 2018/19 regular season , as over 838,000 total fans attended their home games .
