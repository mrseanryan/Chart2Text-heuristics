More than half of Americans wanted to start 2018 by saving money and by getting in shape . The most popular New Year 's resolution ever – `` quit smoking '' – was not as high up on the list as it used to be , but at least 16 percent decided to finally give up smoking once and for all . Resolution makers , resolution keepers ? While some might say that they do not need New Year 's Eve to finally turn their life around , making resolutions on December 31 is a common , well-liked tradition , especially in the Western world . They are usually meant to contain some kind of improvement or betterment of one 's conduct or life choices . However , these resolutions are not compulsive ; only a small share of people who make them actually keep them , according to a Statista survey . They are more like a signal for a new start than an actual catalyst for change . Traditional changes While they signal a change of choices and behavior , New Year 's resolutions themselves hardly ever change : When comparing the resolutions for 2018 and 2019 , for example , it 's obvious that people still just want to be healthy and happy , maybe broaden their horizons , and save up – in general , be a sensible , content adult . This is not only true for Americans – Italians also wish for stable finances and their own and loved ones ' health , as do South Koreans .
