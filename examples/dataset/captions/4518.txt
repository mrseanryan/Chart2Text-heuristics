Steadily declining infant mortality Despite a slight increase in infant mortality in the last two years , medical developments have ensured a remarkable decrease in the number of children dying in their infancy . In 1950 , out of every 1,000 live born babies nearly 27 would die in their first year . This was over seven times as high as today .
