The largest geothermal plant in the world is called the Geysers Geothermal Complex , located in the United States , with a capacity of 1,517 megawatts . It is made up of 22 power plants and spread over several kilometers , located north of San Francisco . It sits on top of a deep magma chamber that spans over 30 square miles . The United States also has one of the highest installed capacities of geothermal power in the world . The thermal efficiency of geothermal plants is low due to the relatively low temperatures of geothermal fluids ; however , its capacity factor tends to be high as it relies on a stable source of energy , unlike wind or solar . How does geothermal energy work ? Geothermal energy taps into the thermal energy and radioactive decay leftover from the formation of the Earth . Geothermal plants generates energy by carrying heat to the surface via fluid circulation through various types of mechanics . The plants rely on steam generated from heated water and processed through several methods , including dry steam , flash steam , and binary cycle . Currently , Indonesia and the Philippines are in the process of developing some of the largest geothermal projects in the world . Asia has some of the largest geothermal resources in the world . These resource potentials are usually highest near geological fault lines .
