Body modification , especially tattooing , has proven to be very popular over the last few years . In the United States alone , more than a quarter of the population is adorned with at least one tattoo , and less than 40 percent of Americans would rule out getting one completely . Most get their first in their twenties , and the vast majority never regrets that first prick of the needle . In other countries , the share of tattooed inhabitants is even higher . Tattoos have not always been that socially acceptable , though : For a long time , they were sure indicators that their owner was up to no good . Fringe markings Only a few decades ago , tattooed people were often perceived as socially inadequate , maladaptive , and even as criminal . Body ink was associated with people who lived on the fringes of society , people who had been to jail or worked as sailors at best . Nowadays , tattooed people are often still considered more rebellious and less respectable than those without , but having a tattoo does not lead to social ostracism anymore . In fact , they are becoming more and more mainstream . Hoist the colors Today , tattoos are a means of self-expression , especially embraced by the younger generations . They have become acceptable for professionals as well , while they have been hidden in public under long sleeves and collars for decades , they are now often shown off proudly ; professional reasons are rarely cited for not having a tattoo nowadays . The insignificance of professional reasons becomes even clearer when looking at how socially acceptable visible tattoos have become for `` respectable '' professions , like doctors or police officers . Other body modifications , like piercings , are also becoming mainstream , and at this rate , it wo n't be long until we see a judge with a nose stud or a doctor with a lip ring .
