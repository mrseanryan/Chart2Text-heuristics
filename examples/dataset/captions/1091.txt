Fiat Panda was by far the most popular model reaching 138,132 units sold , followed by Lancia Ypsilon and Dacia Duster . Other foreign brands appear in the leading car brands , such as Ford and Volkswagen . Patriotism or costs and benefits ? The ranking clearly points at the major role played by small cars due to multiple aspects such as fuel consumption , taxation , general maintenance , insurance and product life cycle . Besides Fiat Panda ( which is a segment A car ) , the first five position are taken by segment B cars such as the French Renault Clio , with 41,683 units sold . The majority of Italians are not yet into electric cars Although Italians are concerned about the environment and emissions into the atmosphere , electric cars were not ranked high among the most sold cars in Italy . However , their sales volume was forecasted to increase in the coming years . According to a 2018 survey of Kantar , the share of new car buyers who bought alternative vehicles in Italy reached 14 percent for CNG and LPG vehicles and seven percent for hybrid electric cars .
