Major League Baseball ( MLB ) is one of the biggest sporting leagues in the United States and its most valuable team , the New York Yankees , are also the most-followed MLB team on Facebook with almost 8.53 million followers as of February 2020 . MLB value and revenue In 2019 , the teams in Major League Baseball are valued at an average of 1.78 billion U.S. dollars . Total MLB league revenue in 2018 amounted to 9.9 billion U.S. dollars , the highest ever . The New York Yankees are one of the most popular teams in the league , ranking third in regular season home attendance behind the LA Dodgers and St. Louis Cardinals . The average ticket price for New York Yankees games in the MLB was 47.62 U.S. dollars in 2019 . MLB and social media adoption Despite the sport 's prominence , the MLB is lagging behind other U.S. sports leagues such as the NBA ( National Basketball Association ) or the NFL ( National Football League ) on social media . This is largely due to a late adoption of the medium and the possibly strictest social media policy of any major sports league , prohibiting not only fans but also teams and TV stations from promoting and discussing content on social media . In February 2019 , the MLB had agreed to loosen some of its rules regarding the use of licensed content and will allow players to post more material regarding matches on social media . This reversal on policy is largely due to the need to engage with younger sports audiences , who frequently discuss sports on social media .
