In baseball terms , a home run is a hit that allows the batter to run all the way around the bases and reach home safely . Home runs are generally achieved when the ball is hit over the outfield without touching the ground first . In Major League Baseball , Barry Bonds leads the pack of all-time home run scorers . He hit a record 762 home runs in his career between 1986 and 2007 , during which time he played for the Pittsburgh Pirates and the San Francisco Giants . MLB legends – Barry Bonds In no small part as a result of his outstanding home run record , Barry Bonds is considered one of the greatest baseball players of all time . It is therefore surprising that he is yet to be inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame , although the San Francisco Giants did elect him to their Wall of Fame and retired the No . 25 jersey in his honor . Interestingly , Barry Bonds does not lead the list of all-time home runs scored for the San Francisco Giants – this accolade is held by Willie Mays , who is in sixth on the all-time league home run list . MLB legends – Babe Ruth One man who did make it into the National Baseball Hall of Fame and who is often called the greatest baseball player of all time is Babe Ruth . The Yankees Legend is top of the team 's all-time home run list , having smashed 659 home runs during his 14-year career in New York . Not only was the Yankees ' No . 3 shirt retired in his honor , but he was also inducted to the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame , despite only playing for them for a comparatively short five years . Babe Ruth is second on the list of MLB all-time RBI ( runs batted in ) leaders , only behind Hank Aaron , who spent his whole career playing in Milwaukee . The player who appeared the most times overall in the MLB is Pete Rose , who played a total of 3,562 games in a career spanning 23 years .
