In 2018 , the population of cattle and calves in the United Kingdom was approximately 9.61 million , a slight decrease from the previous year . This was the lowest number for the entire period shown in this graph . Despite a small rebound in 2014 and 2015 this constitutes a slow long-term decline of herd sizes . Beef production In 2018 , two million animals that can be considered prime cattle were slaughtered . Older adult animals and calves amounted for slightly over 800,000 slaughtered animals . The average prime cattle carcass weighted 350 kilograms in 2018 . As of the 6th of July 2019 , prices for deadweight prime cattle reached a low of 327.5 p/kg . It is likely that more environmentally conscious and ethically minded consumers , which drive the trend for an increased demand of plant-based food , are responsible for the currently low price , which is decidedly under the five-year average . Environmental impact Beef consistently ranks among the most environmentally damaging food products . It produces the highest acidifying emissions per gram of protein , the most eutrophying ( over enriching water with nutrients and minerals ) emissions per gram of protein and requires the most water per ton of meat . Only lambs and sheep use more land per 100 grams of protein produced than cows . Both meat types have a higher CO² footprint than any other food . The enteric fermentation of the cows is the primary source for their greenhouse gas emissions . Emissions amounted to 16.8 million tons of CO² equivalent in the UK in 2017 .
