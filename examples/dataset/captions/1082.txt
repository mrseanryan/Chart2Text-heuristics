Inflation in Myanmar dropped to a five-year low in 2017 , settling at 4.62 percent . This is down from a fairly high spike in 2016 , expected to converge to a steady state around 6 percent in the coming years . For a developing economy , this is an acceptable level , though Myanmar 's central bankers would probably prefer one or two percentage points less . What is inflation ? Inflation is the rise in prices over time . This is often caused by economic growth , and economists consider low , stable growth to be a sign of a healthy economy . The unemployment rate can also cause inflation if it is too low because businesses have to offer higher wages to attract workers . The firms raise prices to pay these higher wages , driving up inflation . Myanmar may be different While the unemployment rate is very low , other indicators may reveal that the labor market still has some slack . Myanmar does not publish the workforce particiaption rate , but one can infer by the low rate of urbanization that many workers may engage in subsistance agriculture or simply not search for jobs , keeping them out of the unemployment statistic . Similarly , the low gross domestic product ( GDP ) per capita may cause workers to stay with a job that is not a good match simply because they do not think they can find another . The hope is that the higher inflation rate will have upward pressure on wages , bringing more wealth to the people of Myanmar .
