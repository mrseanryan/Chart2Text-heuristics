Since it was first released by developer Bluehole in March 2017 , PlayerUnknown 's Battlegrounds ( PUBG ) has developed a loyal legion of fans . While the battle royale game only sold two million copies within the first few months of its Early Access release on Steam , this number had jumped to 50 million units just a year later in June 2018 . One of the biggest games on Steam PUBG is an online multiplayer game which pits up to 100 players against each other at one time . The players must scavenge for weapons and items while killing enemies and trying to survive . The map shrinks over time in order to force the remaining players into combat until only one player or team is left standing . Given the scale of the game , it is unsurprising that it attracts large amounts of players – on the gaming platform Steam , PUBG peaked at almost 3.24 million concurrent players in January 2018 . The game is also Steam 's biggest draw in terms of hourly average number of players – PUBG averaged almost 853 thousand players per hour in 2018 , almost twice the figure of its closest competitor , DOTA 2 . So is the game unrivalled in the battle royale genre ? PUBG 's biggest rival Not if you ask fans of Fortnite . Released by Epic Games in July 2017 , just a few months after the launch of PUBG , Fortnite is a similar battle royale survival game . While it is not available on Steam , it can be played on PC as well as on all the main consoles . Similarly to PUBG , Fortnite became an overnight sensation and latest figures have the game at a staggering 250 million registered users . The mobile version of the game has also been a commercial success , generating annual revenue of 455 million U.S. dollars in the Apple App Store alone in 2018 . Given that PUBG won the Best Multiplayer Game at The Game Awards 2017 and Fortnite won the very same award a year later , it seems that the rivalry between these games shows no signs of slowing down .
