The median initial public offering ( IPO ) in the United States was 108 million U.S. dollars in 2019 . This figure gives an idea of how willing speculators in the United States are to invest in a company going public , which is the process of being listed on a stock exchange for the first time . Who goes public ? Most IPOs come from relatively new firms that have grown quickly . For example , the Alibaba Group Holding IPO was the largest IPO in the United States . This firm is a relatively new tech company overseen by Jack Ma , who had already generated billions in private funding before going public . However , Visa 's 2008 IPO occurred 50 years after the company 's founding , when it had millions of credit cards in circulation . Still , the company had generated enough enthusiasm for its IPO to raise a record amount of money . Over and under the median The megadeals such as the Alibaba IPO are rare , though there is an increasing number of startup companies valued at one billion U.S. dollars . While these raise the median value , the worst IPOs lower it . While a successful IPO can lead to huge gains in valuation , the IPOs with the lowest return lose over half the company 's value . For this reason , companies are willing to pay significant underwriter fees to ensure a smooth first day in the public markets .
