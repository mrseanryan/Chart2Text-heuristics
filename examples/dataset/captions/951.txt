This statistic shows the national debt of Ireland from 2014 to 2018 , with projections up until 2024 . In 2018 , the national debt of Ireland was around 226.92 billion U.S. dollars . For comparison , the Greek debt amounted to approximately 303 billion euros that same year . In a ranking of debt to GDP per country , Ireland is thus currently ranked tenth , while Greece is ranked second . Ireland and the economic crisis Ireland has been severely affected by the economic crisis owing mainly to the bursting of its real estate bubble in 2007 . The crisis led to a dramatic decline in real estate prices and was a major factor in the financial and banking crisis , causing Ireland to enter recession in 2008 â€“ which means that the economy underwent a period of decline , unemployment figures soared , numerous bankruptcies resulted and many businesses were forced into closure , and inflation and GDP declined . Ireland 's budget balance seems to be in remission from a severe state deficit in 2010 . It continues to show negative figures to this day . Ireland was not the only country to be hit severely by the economic crisis , other countries are also suffering : Portugal , for example , reported an ever higher national debt than Ireland in 2012 and an even higher state deficit . Spain is another casualty ; it has been reporting extraordinarily high unemployment figures since 2008 , the rate of unemployment is still on the rise . The country suffering most due to the economic crisis , however , was and still is Greece , with a national debt almost one-and-a-half times as large as Ireland 's at times , and an unemployment rate to rival that of Spain , as well as a devastated economy . As for Ireland , the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and the European Union 's European Financial Stability Facility ( EFSF ) agreed to support the country financially with a loan in 2010 . However , the country is still not out of recession and might struggle to secure economic recovery for another few years at least .
