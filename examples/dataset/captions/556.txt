The statistic shows the national debt in India from 2014 to 2018 in relation to gross domestic product ( GDP ) , with projections up until 2024 . In 2018 , the national debt of India amounted to about 68.05 percent of the gross domestic product . India 's economy on the rise India is one of the most populous countries in the world , and although a large share of inhabitants are living below the poverty line – or probably due to this fact – , the country 's economy is growing steadily . India 's GDP growth is expected to remain steady at more than 7 percent for the next few years , which is almost double that of the global GDP , and both GDP and GDP per capita are expected to increase significantly . Almost half of India 's workforce is employed in the agricultural sector , but services and industry share the other half quite equally . India 's GDP is mostly generated by the services sector , which includes transport , retailing , and offering services in the hospitality and tourism industry . India 's trade balance has been in the red for a decade now , but seems to recover slowly . A trade deficit usually means that a country 's import costs are higher than the amount of money generated with exporting goods . India 's imports could not be compensated for by the country 's exports , as imports have been consistently , even if only slightly , higher over the years both in terms of volume and value . Still , all signs point to India 's economy growing and thriving , reducing India 's debt ( as seen above ) and unemployment rate , enabling the inhabitants to create a better life for themselves .
