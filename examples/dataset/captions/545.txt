In the United States , the most popular television programs are by far those within the drama category . A 2017 study showed that 33 percent of primetime TV programs were drama shows , almost double the share of comedy or reality programs . What affects genre preferences ? An interesting way in which the popularity of a genre can change is looking at data pertaining to a viewer 's age . A 2018 survey revealed that whilst 92 percent of U.S. adults considered drama TV shows to be very or somewhat favorable , the genre was much less popular among 18 to 29-year-olds . In fact , favorability of drama TV shows decreased with age , whereas with the horror genre the opposite was the case , with favorability dropping significantly among older respondents . Reality TV was considered the least favorable among all age groups , and the top terms used to describe reality TV were ‘ fake ' _ , ‘ trashy ' and ‘ meaningless ' _ . Another factor which has the potential to affect a TV viewer 's preferences is episode length . For TV dramas , 60 minutes was the preferred episode length , with viewers overwhelmingly citing a show lasting an hour as being preferable to one lasting 30 , 90 or 120 minutes .
