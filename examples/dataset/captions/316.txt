Since it was first launched in 2004 , Facebook has developed from a humble social media page to a global phenomenon . The site can be used for catching up with friends , advertising businesses , and passing the time with games . The two most popular games on the social media site are 8 Ball Pool and Candy Crush Saga , both of which boasted 10 million daily active users in 2019 . Candy Crush 's sweet success Developed by King , Candy Crush Saga is a puzzle video game in which players swap different types of candy on a game board in order to match three or more of the same type . The game was first released on Facebook in 2012 and has since become available on most mobile operating systems and on browser . Although the game is free-to-play , users have the choice of purchasing power-ups in order to help them get past particularly tricky levels . The original Candy Crush Saga generated revenue of 945 million U.S. dollars worldwide in 2018 , while the newest release , Candy Crush Friends Saga , generated a further three million U.S. dollars . Unsurprisingly , King has seen its revenue skyrocket after the global success of Candy Crush â€“ the comparatively humble revenue of 58.5 million U.S. dollars in 2010 soared to over two billion U.S. dollars by 2018 . King vs. Zynga One of King 's biggest rivals in the social gaming world is Zynga . The company 's best-known game is FarmVille , an agricultural simulation game which launched in 2009 . Its sequel , FarmVille 2 , was launched in 2012 and can still be found on the list of the most popular Facebook games based on number of daily active users . Zynga 's revenue stood at 907 million U.S. dollars in 2018 . The popularity of FarmVille can be seen by the fact that the company 's revenue peaked in 2012 , the year that the game was released .
