Additional information on terrorism in Iraq For nearly two decades Iraq has been one of the foremost battlegrounds in the so-called War on Terror . The number of deaths in Iraq due to terrorism between 2006 and 2018 shows a decline in the number of deaths following 2007 and a subsequent rise in 2013 , followed by a decline again from 2017 . Unfortunately for Iraq citizens this reflects the weakening of Al Qaeda being followed by a destructive rise then fall of Islamic State . Islamic State , who operates in other countries including Iraq 's neighbor Syria , were responsible for the two worst terrorist attacks in 2015 by number of fatalities . The attacks in QAIM and Bani Saad further increased the high frequency of Iraqi fatalities resulting from terrorism . The devastating effect groups such as Islamic State have had on the people in Iraq goes beyond the tragic loss of friends and loved ones . In 2015 , Iraq suffered the second-largest amount of property losses of any country impacted by terrorism . This cost totaled 519 million US dollars . The preferences of terrorist groups in Iraq appear to be geared armed conflicts and bombings . In 2011 , the number of kidnappings in Iraq was far fewer than in Somalia or Afghanistan where kidnappings are regularly committed for the purpose of extortion for political and economic gains .
