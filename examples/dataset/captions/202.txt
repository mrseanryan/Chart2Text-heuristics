In January 2020 , the price for one barrel of West Texas Intermediate ( WTI ) crude oil stood at some 57.52 U.S. dollars . WTI is also known as `` Texas light sweet '' , and is a grade of crude oil often used as a benchmark for oil pricing . Price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil , monthly WTI is also known as `` Texas light sweet '' and is a grade of crude oil . This crude oil has an API gravity of around 39.6 and specific gravity of about 0.827 , which , relative to other crude oils is considered `` light , '' hence the name . WTI also contains about 0.24 percent sulfur , making it a `` sweet '' crude oil . WTI is often used as a benchmark for oil pricing , making the price of Texas light sweet economically significant . The price of WTI can be compared to the prices other of crude oils , i.e . UK Brent crude oil , the OPEC crude oil basket , and Dubai Fateh oil . Prices of WTI per barrel are on average lower than those of the two other crude oils , with the price of OPEC basket oil reaching 65.09 U.S. dollars per barrel in January 2020 , and the UK Brent crude oil price at 63.82 U.S. dollars per barrel that month . WTI crude oil is also the underlying commodity of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange 's oil futures contracts . The recent price development of WTI crude oil relative to Brent crude oil has been influenced by variances in U.S. crude oil transportation and increased U.S. oil production per day . New transportation infrastructure became operational in the United States in early 2013 , easing the movement of crude oil in the U.S. midcontinent and raising the price of WTI . Since then , U.S. refineries have increased production of crude oil to record levels , also raising the price of WTI . Meanwhile , expedited crude transport in the U.S. put downward pressure on Brent crude oil as domestic crude replaced some imported Brent crude . Between 2014 and 2016 , UK Brent prices dropped rapidly , as was the case for all other crude oils .
