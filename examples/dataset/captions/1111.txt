The median age in India was 26.8 years old in 2015 , meaning half the population was older than that , half younger . This figure was lowest in 1970 , at 19.3 years , and was projected to increase to 38.1 years old by 2050 . Aging in India India has the second largest population in the world , after China . Because of the significant population growth of the past years , the age distribution remains skewed in favor of the younger age bracket . This tells a story of rapid population growth , but also of a lower life expectancy . Economic effects of a young population Many young people means that the Indian economy must support a large number of students , who demand education from the economy but can not yet work . Educating the future workforce will be important , because the economy is growing as well and is one of the largest in the world . Failing to do this could lead to high youth unemployment and political consequences . However , a productive and young workforce could provide huge economic returns for India .
