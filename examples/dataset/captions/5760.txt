This statistic shows the total population of Eritrea from 2014 to 2024 . All figures are estimates . In 2018 , the total population of Eritrea was estimated to amount to approximately 6.05 million inhabitants . Decreasing population growth in Eritrea Eritrea is a small country located in East Africa , and like in many other African nations , its population is growing fast . In 2010 , Eritrea had a population of 5.71 million inhabitants and the population is expected to increase to almost 8 million inhabitants by the end of this decade . The high fertility rate is the largest and biggest contributor to population growth in Eritrea , especially considering that the average life expectancy is quite low at around 64 years of age . The fertility rate has decreased somewhat since 2005 , but it was still as high as 4.21 children per woman as of 2015 . This reduction is likely not a result of socio-cultural-economic changes , but rather as a result of conflict ; between 2004 and 2007 , significant reductions to the annual population growth rate can be seen , which is likely because of emigration . It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of Eritreans have fled the country due of poverty , the perceived threat of war and human rights abuse . As of 2015 , more than 379,000 Eritrean citizens had fled their homes , and tensions with neighbor Ethiopia have been and continue to be high .
