Between 2020 and 2021 , the global container market is projected to increase by 4.8 percent . The global market volume reached some 146.4 million twenty-foot equivalent units ( TEU ) in 2018 . Uncertainty in the container market The Hanjin bankruptcy in combination with recent divestments , such as the sale of Maersk 's energy unit , can be seen as indicative of the lack of certainty which is roiling the industry . In light of growing protectionism and political instability , the dynamics of world trade are beginning to affect the global supply chain . While it remains difficult to change the capacity of a vessel , ship scrappage levels remain high and demand for smaller vessels appears to be on the increase . The world 's leading container shippers include the Danish company APM-Maersk , the Swiss company Mediterranean Shg Co , COSCO of China , and the French company CMA CGM Group . APM-Maersk is the world 's leading container ship operator with a fleet of over 600 container ships . The port of Shanghai is the busiest container port in the world . In 2018 , about 42 million twenty-foot equivalent units were handled here .
