In this 2018 survey , eight percent of respondents stated they think the biggest problem for the United States today is Donald Trump . In fact , most of the important problems mentioned are somehow related to the current POTUS – the most mentioned one being immigration and racism . A country divided Since Trump 's inauguration in January 2017 , political camps in the United States are deeply divided and global politics is in turmoil ; Trump 's job approval ratings are notoriously low , and in fact , they are lower than Reagan 's or Nixon 's averages ever were . Trump 's leadership is controversial at best and his executive orders often cause protests , especially among Democrats and liberals – like the travel ban for Muslims . On the other side One of Trump 's main campaign promises was a wall on the border with Mexico in order to keep potential illegal immigrants out and enhance security for American citizens . When he did not get the majority for this plan , he declared a national emergency to force the budget to be allocated , even though the majority of Americans did not support this idea , and it is unclear if the situation at the Mexican border actually warrants it . In fact , the total number of unauthorized immigrants has decreased over the last few years and today , many Americans believe that their country benefits from immigrants and their work .
