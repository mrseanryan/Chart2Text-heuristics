The total health expenditure in South Korea in 2018 accounted for approximately 8.1 percent of Korea 's Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) that year . This was the result of the steepest increase in the past ten years and was the first time health spending as a share of the GDP exceeded eight percent . This share saw a continuous increase over the past decade , indicating that as the GDP grew , health spending grew at an even faster rate . Korea 's GDP per capita was over 33 thousand U.S. dollars in 2018 , increased from around 18.2 thousand dollars in 2009 , while overall medical expenses in 2018 had increased by almost ten percent over the previous year , up to around 14.44 billion South Korean won ( over 12 million U.S. dollars ) . Nearly 60 percent of the costs were covered by the government or the public health insurance system . Higher health spending is still insufficient Even though health spending as a share of the GDP exceeded eight percent in 2018 , this was lower than the OECD average of 8.8 percent . Likewise , the government 's health expenses were around 60 percent and slightly increased from the previous year , but still lower than the OECD average of almost 74 percent . The increased expenditure was largely attributed to the introduction of what is dubbed `` Moon Jae-In Care '' , named after the current Korean president , much like the American Affordable Care Act is colloquially known as `` Obamacare '' . In short , the government will provide greatly expanded coverage for medical treatments and care , increasing the reimbursement rate of the public health insurance , along with other measures . In addition , the Korean population as a whole is rapidly aging , and more people than before are being hospitalized and receiving examinations . Koreans already see doctors far more frequently than any other OECD nationals . Strains on health spending and insurance The Korean national public health insurance system enjoyed seven years of surplus revenue since 2011 but fell into the red in 2018 . As noted above , Moon Jae-In Care and the aging population are largely responsible . The years ' worth of revenue is projected to run out in the coming years . Foreigners who come to Korea as medical tourists make things worse , with an all-time high of over 380 thousand medical tourists to Korea in 2018 .
