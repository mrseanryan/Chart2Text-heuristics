The inflation rate in Germany was 1.93 percent in 2018 , expected to reach 2.13 percent by 2024 . The current rate meets the European Central Bank 's target rate , which is `` below , but close to , 2 percent . '' Many central bankers favor inflation between 2 and 3 percent , but Germans in particular would rather risk deflation than too much inflation . Causes of inflation Central bankers like low , stable inflation because this is a sign of a growing economy . When the economy grows , workers become more productive and spend more , and prices slowly rise . Monetary policy can cause inflation , but Germany has given this responsibility to the European Central Bank ( ECB ) . Importantly , inflation expectations affect inflation , making it a self-fulfilling prophecy . The German context During the eurozone crisis , German politicians were advocating for the ECB to raise interest rates quickly . This would have reduced inflation , possibly causing deflation , but would have presented another hurdle for the struggling Greek economy . This is because of the hyperinflation of the Weimar Republic in the 1920s , when Germans carried their pay home in wheelbarrows because the banknotes had lost so much value . Ever since , Germans often warn that inflation harms pensioners and that personal provisions are necessary in any case . Fortunately for them , this statistic forecasts stable , modest inflation that does not alarm many economists .
