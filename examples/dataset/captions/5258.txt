In 2019 , the crude birth rate in Sweden reached the lowest point in the last thirteen years when it was down to 11.1 . The crude birth rate is defined as the number of live births in a given geographical area in a given time period , per thousand mid-year population . As with the birth rate in Sweden , the fertility rate has also been declining for many years , reaching the lowest value for a long period of years in 2019 . More births than deaths , and more Immigration than emigration Even though the crude birth rate and the fertility rate in Sweden have been declining for years , the population in Sweden is still growing . This is partly due to fewer deaths than births , but also due to the positive migration flow of more immigrants coming into Sweden , than the number of Swedes emigrating . Babies born The number of babies that are born is decided by the number of women in reproductive age living in the country . As a result of an increasing population , in part due to migration , the number of babies that are born over time , remained close to constant in the last decade . In 2019 , around 115 thousand babies were born in Sweden .
