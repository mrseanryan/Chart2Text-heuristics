Population and economy of Poland Poland is the sixth most populated country in the EU , and the ninth most populated one in Europe . After experiencing a minor decline in population from the mid to late 2000s , Poland 's populace has gradually risen annually . Based on current trends , it is estimated that Poland will suffer a population decrease of roughly 4 million in 2050 , an estimate that is highly plausible due to the ongoing financial crisis in Europe . A reason for the country 's slow but certain growth in population could be its economic upturn that has seen momentous improvements over the past decade . Due to industrialization during Russian-ruled Congress Poland as well as the Great Depression , Poland suffered from high amounts of unemployment . However , demand for jobs dramatically increased during the mid 21st century , causing unemployment to plummet .

A further indication of economic upturn is evident in the country 's gross domestic product , which is primarily an indicator of economic strength and production in a country . Poland 's GDP trend coincides with its unemployment rate , having doubled in value and maintained a higher GDP compared to the years prior to the financial crisis of 2008 .
