The house-price-to-income ratio in Canada was equal to 122.33 percent in the first quarter 2019 and was the least affordable country analyzed . This means that house prices in Canada outpaced Canadian incomes by 22.3 percent . It also shows that house prices grew faster than incomes in most of the countries . Portugal , the Netherlands and Ireland were the next most unaffordable countries . Spotlight on Canada The house price to income ratio in Canada steadily rose between 2015 and 2017 , but the ratio has remained steady since then . This is likely due to the cooling of the housing market since 2018 due to the recently introduced mortgage stress test , the foreign buyers tax in British Columbia and higher interest rates . Average house prices in Canada are forecast to drop over the next few years . This should increase housing affordability in the country too , so Canada 's house price to income ratio should fall as a result .
