In 2018 , 63 percent of same-day package deliveries in the United States were for business to consumer ( B2C ) parcels . The remaining market share was split between business to business ( B2B ) and consumer to consumer ( C2C ) deliveries . B2C e-commerce The size of the B2C parcel delivery segment is likely attributable to online retailing . Over the 2010 's , e-commerce has been rapidly growing its share of U.S. retail sales , increasing the demand for express package delivery . To differentiate themselves and meet consumer demand , many online retailers offer same-day shipping services . Amazon 's Prime is the most notable such service , with over half of all U.S. Amazon users having a Prime membership as of June 2019 . E-commerce by segments E-commerce likely also has an effect on the C2C same-day delivery market . Online platforms such as eBay , Craigslist and even Facebook , provide popular services for C2C transactions . The impact is less significant on the B2B market though , with e-commerce only expected to account for 13.1 percent of B2B sales by 2021 .
