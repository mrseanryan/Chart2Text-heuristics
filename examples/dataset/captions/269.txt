The statistic shows the total population in Japan from 2014 to 2017 , with projections up until 2024 . In 2017 , the total population of Japan amounted to around 126.75 million inhabitants . See the figures for the population of South Korea for comparison . Total population in Japan From steadily low fertility rates to a growing elderly population , it is no secret that Japan 's population is shrinking . Population growth rates jump around a little , but are currently following a declining trend . The post-war baby boom generation is now in the 65-and-over age group , and the percentage of the population in that category is expected to keep growing , as is indicated by a high median age and high life expectancy . Japan already has the highest percentage of its population over 65 in the world , and the aging population puts some pressure on the Japanese government to provide welfare services for more people as rising numbers leave the workforce . However , the amount of jobs opened up for the younger generations by the older generations leaving the workforce means that unemployment is kept to a minimum . Despite a jump in unemployment after the global recession hit in 2008 , rates were almost back to pre-recession rates by 2013 . Another factor affecting Japan is the number of emigrants to other countries . The United States absorbs a number of emigrants worldwide , so despite a stagnating birth rate , the U.S. has seen a steady rise in population .
