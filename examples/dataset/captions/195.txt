The statistic shows the unemployment rate for China from 2012 to 2017 , with projections up until 2024 . In 2017 , China 's unemployment rate ranged at about 3.9 percent . Unemployment rate in China â€“ additional information From the statistic at hand one can see that the unemployment rate in China has been fairly constant at around four percent over the last few years . This may be partly explained by the fact that due to its socialist heritage , full employment policy historically has played a major role in economic considerations of the Chinese government . Another possible explanation may be found in the index 's methodology , which , according to the National Bureau of Statistics , gathers only employment data for urban regions . The debate as to whether to adjust the methodology accordingly in order to create a more accurate statistical image is still ongoing among Chinese politicians and statisticians . A main concern in China 's current state of employment lies within the still large regional differences . As of 2016 , the unemployment rate in more central and western regions of China was notably higher than in China 's eastern parts . In Beijing , China 's political and cultural center , unemployment ranged at merely 1.4 percent for 2016 . Youth unemployment is also apparent in China , but with its own characteristics . Young people with higher education are more likely to have difficulty finding a job , according to the China Household Finance Survey . One reason for this might lie in the enrollment expansion since 1999 . The number of newly enrolled students in public universities skyrocketed from around 2.7 million in 2001 to roughly 7.5 million in 2016 . Apart from the unemployment rate , most commonly used indicators to measure economic activities of a country are GDP growth and inflation rate . According to an IMF forecast , GDP growth in China will slow down to about 6.3 percent in 2019 , depicting a four-percent decrease from 10.61 percent in 2010 . This estimate is backed up by quarterly growth data published by the NBS , which recently reported 1.4 percent GDP growth for the first quarter of 2018 .
