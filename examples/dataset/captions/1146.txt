Turkey 's economy on the decline ? Turkey 's gross domestic product has been on a decline for the past years and is estimated to hit rock bottom in 2019 , with a projected steep upturn afterwards . At the same time , inflation is set to peak at almost 17.5 percent the same year , and unemployment is on the rise . All in all , the figures do not look promising for Turkey , but at least estimations assume a quick recovery . However , this economic development is likely due to the political path the country has chosen in recent years , and it remains to be seen if the forecasts will prove true in the future or if Turkey 's economy needs to brace itself for a further downturn instead .
