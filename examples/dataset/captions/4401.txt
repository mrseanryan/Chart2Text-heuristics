In 2018 , around 275 terawatt hours of wind electricity were generated in the United States . That year , wind power was by far the largest non-hydroelectric renewable energy source used in the United States , followed by solar and thermal . Clean energy on the rise The highest increase in clean energy investments came in the years leading up to the 2008 financial crisis . Since then , investments in clean energy have continued to grow , but more slowly and inconsistently . Nevertheless , larger investments in clean energy in the past decade have brought higher generation of wind and solar power . The sharpest rise in wind power generation came in 2008 , while solar power generation saw a much larger increase around 2013 , its most substantial rise before progressing at smaller intervals again . The globalized U.S. wind market Based in Copenhagen , the Danish company Vestas holds a large portion of the global wind manufacturer market share . Vestas electricity deliveries were the highest to the United States . Though the United States has generated increasing amounts of wind power , the U.S. continues to source much of its wind power turbines and equipment from international companies such as Vestas .
