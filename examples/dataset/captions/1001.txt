In 2018 , China had more smartphone users than any country in the world at over 850 million . India had the second most smartphone users , though less than half as many as China . These two countries are expected to continue to lead the smartphone user ranking , as China and India also rank one and two in regards to the largest populations worldwide and still have strong growth potential due to a relatively low smartphone penetration rate . Smartphone penetration as economic indicator The smartphone penetration rate can be used as one indicator to measure how advanced the economy of a country is . A smartphone penetration rate above 70 percent , for example , is common in countries with advanced economies . Outside Western Europe and the United States , smartphone penetration was highest in South Korea , Israel , and Australia , as more than 80 percent of the population in these countries is using a smartphone . Japan and Canada are notable exceptions to the 70 percent line , with penetration rates just over 65 percent . In Canada , a quarter of the population is not even using a basic mobile phone . Smartphone growth opportunities After annual smartphone sales more than tripled from 2009 to 2015 , the market began to plateau around 1.5 million units per year . Growth for the smartphone market is , however , still possible in emerging economies in Africa with large populations , such as Egypt , Kenya , Ethiopia , Congo , Tanzania , and Nigeria , where mobile phone penetration is already high or picking up , but smartphones are not as pronounced yet .
