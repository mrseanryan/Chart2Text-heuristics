The statistic shows the most significant natural disasters by death toll from 1980 to 2019 . In 2010 , the earthquake in Haiti killed 159,000 people . Ten deadliest natural disasters worldwide since 1980 According to data published by Münchener Rückversicherungs-Gesellschaft ( or Munich Re ) , the second-largest global reinsurance group as of 2017 , the tsunami struck in 2004 was the deadliest natural disaster to occur worldwide between the years 1980 and 2019 . In that event , an estimated 222,000 people were killed ( though other estimates suggest higher death tolls ) . Second deadliest was the earthquake that affected Haiti in January 2010 . There were 159,000 fatalities reported in that event . The earthquake in Haiti in 2010 was also the deadliest earthquake to occur between 1990 and 2016 , according to a ranking of great earthquakes by death toll published by the United States Geological Survey ( USGS ) . According to the USGS , the earthquake in Haiti took 316,000 lives , injured 300,000 , displaced 1.3 million , destroyed 97,294 and damaged 188,383 houses . Sixty percent of the country 's hospitals and eighty percent of the country 's schools were destroyed . It was the worst earthquake to hit the Caribbean in 200 years , with a magnitude of 7.0 at its epicenter only 25 kilometers away from Haiti 's capital , Port-au-Prince . Poor construction practices were to blame for many of the deaths—Haiti 's buildings were not earthquake resistant and were not built according to building code , due to a lack of licensed building professionals . High population density was also to blame for the fatalities . One fourth of the country 's inhabitants lived in the Port-au-Prince area , meaning one half of the country 's population was directly affected by the earthquake . In response to the earthquake , Haiti received 340,000 pounds of food aid from the United States in 2010 . The United States donated 1.17 billion U.S. dollars worth of relief aid , which accounted for 34.7 percent of the total amount donated .
