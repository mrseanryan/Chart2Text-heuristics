In 2018 , there were about 4.04 million Black families in the United States with a single mother . This is an increase from 1990 levels , when there were about 3.4 million Black families with a single mother . Single parenthood The typical family is comprised of two parents and at least one child . However , that is not the case in every single situation . A single parent is someone who has a child but no spouse or partner . Single parenthood occurs for different reasons , including divorce , death , abandonment , or single-person adoption . Historically , single parenthood was common due to mortality rates due to war , diseases , and maternal mortality . However , divorce was not as common back then , depending on the culture . Single parent wellbeing In countries where social welfare programs are not strong , single parents tend to suffer more financially , emotionally , and mentally . In the United States , most single parents are mothers . The struggles that single parents face are greater than those in two parent households . The number of families with a single mother in the United States has increased since 1990 , but the poverty rate of black families with a single mother has significantly decreased since that same year . In comparison , the poverty rate of Asian families with a single mother , and the percentage of white , non-Hispanic families with a single mother who live below the poverty level in the United States have both been fluctuating since 2002 .
