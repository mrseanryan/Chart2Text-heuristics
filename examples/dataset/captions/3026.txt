Recreational boating is the use of a boating vessel for leisure purposes . This often only involves travel on the water itself but can also include water related activities such as fishing . It is a popular activity in the U.S. , with rising participation in recent years . In 2014 , 87.3 million U.S. adults participated in recreational boating . The most popular type of boat used for recreational boating in the U.S. is the outboard boat . Outboard boats are usually small watercraft with a motor attached to the outside of vessel . While they are the most common type of boat in use , the number of outboard boats sold annually in the U.S. has declined significantly since 2000 . In 2013 , around 135 thousand outboard boats were sold at an average unit price of 22 thousand U.S. dollars . Between 2000 and 2013 , the average unit price increased markedly , which is perhaps a reason for the declining sales volume during those years .
