In 2018 , the electric power industry in the United States generated a revenue of about 406.5 billion U.S. dollars . Electric Power Industry The electric power industry consists of the generation , transmission , and distribution of electric power to the public . First developed in the late 1800 's , the electric power industry has evolved tremendously . At first , the industry began as a `` natural monopoly '' as limiting the number of organizations participating would make the market more efficient . The industry was subsequently broken up , separating generation and distribution of electricity , to create a more competitive market . The industry is normally regulated through price controls , and typically state owned . However , in recent history , the United States has begun to deregulate the electric power industry . Fossil fuel power in the United States Natural resources such as coal , petroleum , and gas are vital resources used in the United States for the electric power industry . Unfortunately , fossil fuels are finite resources . The average cost of coal for the electric power industry in the United States has been fluctuating since 2005 , but has seen a recent decrease . The average cost of petroleum has seen higher waves of fluctuation in the last decade . On the other hand , the average cost of natural gas has drastically decreased over the last years .
