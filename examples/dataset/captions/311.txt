In 2017 , the inflation rate of the United Arab Emirates was at 1.97 percent compared to the previous year . For 2018 , estimates show a sharp increase of over 3.07 percent , before inflation slumps back to around two percent in 2024 . Oil is keeping everything afloat The economy of the United Arab Emirates heavily relies on oil and its respective revenues . The UAE possess vast stable oil reserves , and crude oil production is steadily increasing . Naturally , oil exports – mostly to the Asia-Pacific region – are the main economic driver , and the industrial and services sectors have divided generation of GDP almost evenly among themselves . Oil has caused the UAE economy to thrive and caused an impressive trade surplus just a few years ago , before a dramatic ( but still not overly concerning ) slump . Oil is dragging everything down When oil prices decreased , so did the trade surplus , and inflation mirrored this by skyrocketing from around one percent to over four percent in three years . Another three years later , in 2018 , it spiked again at over 3.5 percent – another response to dropping oil prices . Diversifying the economy is one way for the UAE to diminish oil 's monopoly ; tourism has been a growing industry over the last few years and might just stabilize inflation if another oil price slump hits .
