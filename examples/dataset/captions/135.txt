Small-town America Suffice it to say , almost nothing is more idealized in the American imagination than small-town America . When asked where they would prefer to live , 30 percent of Americans reported that they would prefer to live in a small town . Americans tend to prefer small-town living due to a perceived slower pace of life , close-knit communities , and a more affordable cost of living when compared to large cities . An increasing population Despite a preference for small-town life , metropolitan areas in the U.S. still see high population figures , with the New York , Los Angeles , and Chicago metro areas being the most populous in the country . Metro and state populations are projected to increase by 2040 , so while some may move to small towns to escape city living , those small towns may become more crowded in the upcoming decades .
