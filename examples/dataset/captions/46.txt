This statistic displays the annual exchange rate ( average or standardized measure ) of the euro to the U.S. dollar ( EUR USD ) , according to the data from the European Central Bank , which cover the period from the introduction of the euro in 1999 up until 2019 . The average ( standardized ) measure is based on the calculation of many observations throughout the period in question . It is therefore different than an annual measure at point in time , which reflects concrete values as of end of the year . Between the years of 2001 and 2008 , the average annual exchange rate of the euro to the U.S. dollar noted a steep increase . In 2008 , the euro to U.S. dollar annual average exchange rate was equal to 1.47 , which meant that one euro could buy 1.47 U.S. dollars . By 2019 this value had decreased overall , to a value of 1.12 which meant that one euro could buy 1.12 U.S. dollars . Similar dynamics in the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate were also reflected in the monthly exchange rate in recent years .
