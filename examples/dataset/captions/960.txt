Between 2006 and 2007 there was a sudden drop in average farm size , but in recent years it has recovered and once again reached the same levels as its peak in 2006 . Agriculture in the United States In 2018 there were about 2.03 million farms in the United States , down from 2.2 million in 2007 . It appears that as average farm size has increased , the number of individual farms in the United States has decreased . Texas is home to the highest number of farms of any U.S. state , with 248,000 farms as of 2018 . Major Crops in the United States The United States produces a wide variety of crops . Though the production volumes of some major crops , such as wheat , have fluctuated considerably since 2000 , the production of vegetables for processing has been on the rise in recent years . Grapes , apples , and oranges are the most produced fruits in the United States , with the majority of grapes being grown in California .
