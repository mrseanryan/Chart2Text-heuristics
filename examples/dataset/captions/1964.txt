This statistic shows the value of gross domestic product ( GDP ) per capita at current prices in Scotland from 2000 to 2018 . From 2000 to 2008 the gross domestic product at current prices increased each year . There was a decrease in 2009 and 2010 , this was almost certainly due to the effect of the global financial crisis on the market value of all final goods and services produced in Scotland in that year , yet from 2010 Scottish GDP almost fully recovered , growth of GDP per head increased annually thereafter . A very similar trend can be seen in the development of annual GDP at market prices and annual GDP excluding North Sea revenue . Quarterly GDP at current market prices is also available as well as quarterly GDP per capita .
