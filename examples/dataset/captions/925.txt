The homeownership rate in the United States amounted to 65.1 percent in 2019 . The homeownership rate is the proportion of occupied households which are occupied by the owners . This reached its peak in 2004 before the 2007 - 2009 recession hit and decimated the housing market . The rate continued to fall until 2016 , but has begun to increase again since then . Homeownership since the recession The rate of homeownership in the U.S. fell in the lead up to the recession and continued to do so until 2016 . In spite of this trend , the share of Americans who perceived homeownership as part of their personal American dream remained relatively stable . This suggests that the financial hardship caused by the recession led to the fall in homeownership , rather than a change in opinion about the importance of homeownership itself . What the future holds for homeownership Homeownership trends vary from generation to generation . Homeownership among Americans over 65 years old is declining , whereas most Millennial renters plan to buy a home in the near future . This suggests that homeownership will remain important in the future , as Millennials are forecast to head most households over the next two decades .
