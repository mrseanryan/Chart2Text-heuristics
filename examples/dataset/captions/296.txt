Recent figures tell us that the United States spent 17.9 percent of its gross domestic product on health care in 2017 . Projections show us that in the subsequent two years the health spending in regards to GDP will stagnate . The United States has the highest health spending based on GDP share among developed countries . While public spending in the U.S. is on line with other developed countries , private health spending is much higher in the United States . Why the U.S. pays so much more While private health spending in Canada stays at around three percent and in Germany under two percent of the gross domestic product , it is nearly nine percent in the United States . Another reason for high costs can be found in physicians ' salaries , which are much higher in the U.S. than in other wealthy countries . A general practitioner in the U.S. earns nearly twice as much as the average physician in other high-income countries . Additionally , medicine spending per capita is also significantly higher in the United States . Finally , inflated health care administration costs are another of the predominant factors which make health care spending in the U.S. out of proportion . It is important to state that Americans do not pay more because they have a higher health care utilization , but mainly because of higher prices . Expected developments By 2027 , it is expected that health care spending in the U.S. will reach nearly one fifth of the nation 's gross domestic product . Or clearly spoken , health care expenditures will accumulate to about six trillion U.S. dollars in total .
