In 2019 , the unemployment rate of African Americans in the United States stood at 6.1 percent . This was over 1.6 times the national average of 3.7 percent . The high rate of unemployment There are many reasons why the unemployment rate among minorities is different than the national average . When it comes to African Americans , a large part of this is due to historical events , such as slavery and the struggle for civil rights , as well as the number of black families living below the poverty level . Additionally , in 2017 , for every 100,000 of the population , there were 2,336 black men in prison . This high rate of imprisonment can contribute to the unemployment rate for African Americans , since having been in prison can reduce one 's chances of finding a job once released . Earning differences African Americans also make less money than other ethnicities in the United States . In 2018 , the median weekly earnings of African Americans were 694 U.S. dollars , compared Asians , who made 1,095 U.S. dollars per week , and whites , who made 886 U.S. dollars per week . While the African American unemployment rate may be the lowest it has ever been , it is clear that much has to change in order to achieve full equality .
