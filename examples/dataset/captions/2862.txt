In 2020 , it was forecasted that Malaysians would consume an estimated 49.4 kilograms of poultry meat per person . This puts Malaysia amongst the top global consumers of poultry meat worldwide . Meat production has been proven to have adverse effects on the environment and global climate , and scientists have recommended drastically reducing the amount of mean consumed . However , Malaysian consumers were still reluctant to give up their meat . Climate impact of poultry consumption In 2015 , the global per capita consumption of poultry meat was 13.8 kilograms , compared to 47.26 kilograms in Malaysia . While poultry meat produced less greenhouse gas emissions compared to cattle , they still produced the second highest amount of emissions per kilocalorie out of a range of agricultural products . With such high levels of poultry consumption , as well as beef , the average diet of the Malaysian consumer could be said to be harmful for the environment and climate . Consumer reluctance to go meat-free While vegetarianism and veganism are increasing in popularity globally , Malaysian consumers were not yet jumping on the meat-free trend . An overwhelming majority of Malaysian consumers were unwilling to go vegetarian . Completely giving up meat might not be feasible for the average person . With the recent advances in plant-based proteins , however , reducing meat consumption by using meat substitutes without compromising on taste were becoming viable options . Even so , more than half of Malaysian consumers were still unwilling to substitute meat for plant-based alternatives .
