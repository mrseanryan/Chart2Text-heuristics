Over 30 million twenty-foot equivalent units ( TEU ) of cargo are expected to be transported across the Pacific Ocean in 2019 , making Trans-Pacific routes the largest shipping zone in terms of load size . As a result of growing globalization , the volume of seaborne trade reached some 11 billion metric tons in 2016 . Trade boom in Asia Asian economies are experiencing a boom . They are home to the world 's leading container ports . The largest container ship fleets worldwide are also registered here . Trade and pollution Although seaborne freight is still widely regarded as one of the most efficient modes of transport with regards to weight to carbon dioxide emissions , it is also apparent that large , diesel engine-propelled ships contribute to the increased production of greenhouse gases , such as carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) , as well as other pollutants such as sulfur dioxide . Maritime transport produces 2.6 percent of global CO2 emissions , the majority of which is caused by three major ship classes : container ships , bulk carriers , and oil tankers . Improved efficiency of ships across nearly all class types has reduced the carbon intensity of the world 's fleet . However , CO2 emissions are increasingly produced in other areas , such as the tourism industry , where higher levels of efficiency are offset by a rise in the number of cruise liner ships .
