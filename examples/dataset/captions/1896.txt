The global solar energy market is expected to reach 422 billion U.S. dollars in 2022 , in comparison to 86 billion U.S. dollars in 2015 . Solar energy is one of the most popular renewable energy sources and in recent years more capacity was deployed than traditional energy sources . The success related to the solar energy segment can be attributed to the declining cost of installing solar photovoltaic systems . Regional solar markets China and the United States were two of the largest solar markets in the world , driving a large portion of global solar demand . Europe , on the other hand , had experienced a declining solar market for over five years , but has seen growth recently due to Turkey 's expansion of solar capacity . These mature markets are expected to reduce their hold on the market as emerging markets in Latin America , the Middle East , and Africa grow . However , solar prices in emerging markets will be much higher than in developed markets as business situations can be less than ideal . In these cases , development financing institutions may help cover risks associated with financing solar projects .
