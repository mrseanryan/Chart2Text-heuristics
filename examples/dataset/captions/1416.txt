This statistic illustrates the global market share of solar photovoltaic ( PV ) module manufacturers in 2017 , based on market share . That year , China 's Trina Solar held the second largest market share with around 9.3 percent , based on revenues . The solar PV module market continues to be dominated by Asian companies : nine out of twelve companies in the list are based in China . The leading solar PV module manufacturers , based on market share A solar photovoltaic module typically consists of a set of solar cells . When exposed to light , these small electrical devices absorb the light and convert photons into electricity . Semiconductor materials such as silicon are the fundamental building blocks of a solar cell . Monocrystalline silicon and thin-film silicon technologies are the materials that are predominantly employed in solar cell manufacturing . In light of dwindling solar cell prices , many once successful manufacturers , such as Germany 's Q-Cells - which is now a subsidiary of the Hanwha Group - , have been squeezed out of the market . On the upside , this trend has helped making solar photovoltaic power become more affordable . Solar electricity is expected to be less consistently costly than power generated fossil fuels in the near future . The global solar power market is expected to reach 158.4 billion U.S. dollars , with China being the largest market for solar cells and modules . China was home to nine of the world 's leading solar module manufacturers in 2017 . The Chinese manufacturers Yingli and Trina Solar are considered two of the world 's leading manufacturers in the field of solar photovoltaic modules .
