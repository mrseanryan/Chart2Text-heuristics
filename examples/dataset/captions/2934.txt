The statistic shows the development of the world population since the birth of Christ . 6.9 billion people were living on earth in 2010 . Additional information on world population The global population has risen dramatically in the last 100 years from 1.65 billion in 1900 to surpassing 7 billion in 2011 . The most significant driver of this population change has been the reduction of global mortality rates . Scientific research and well organized health policy implementation have ensured that epidemics such as the HIV/AIDS epidemic can be combated more effectively to save the lives of those at risk . Declining infant mortality rates are a triumphant example of health improvements , especially in North Africa and the Middle East . Infant mortality rates have also declined in more economically developed countries such as the United States . China and India are now the most populous countries in the world , together accounting for over one third of the world population . Recent trends suggest these countries will continue to have high fertility rates until they reach a higher level of economic development . The trend of fertility rates below 2.1 per women , the rate considered to be necessary to retain the population level , is evident in developed countries such as Singapore . However , countries such as Singapore can retain their population level through increased immigration rather than increasing fertility rates . Some critics have argued that the issue of population rise should regain a prominent place in the international political agenda . Recent studies including a 2014 study at the University of Washington have placed doubt on the claim that the global population will peak at 9 billion around 2050 . The issue is important as growing populations place higher strain on both natural and public resources including healthcare and education .
