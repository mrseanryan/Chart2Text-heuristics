Turkey 's economic situation Based on the current state of its economy , Turkey is defined as an emerging market and one of the newly industrialized countries in the world . Turkey is identified as one of the members of the G-20 major economies and is also a member of the EU Customs Union , allowing for custom-free trade amongst all member states . Like every other country 's economy , Turkey 's economy is primarily made up of three different sectors ; agriculture , industry and services . Over the past decade , Turkey has shifted more focus to its services sector , most notably tourism , communications and transport , while slightly decreasing its dependency on the agricultural and industrial aspects . While many other countries have struggled to recover from the 2008 global financial crisis as well as the Eurozone crisis , the Turkish economy returned to its pre-crisis form in several years and has since seen exponential economic growth and higher productivity and efficiency , more than double the amount compared to a decade prior . With regards to total GDP , government spending within the country has remained relatively low and has remained stable over the past decade , in comparison to developed EU countries , which may be spending more than they can afford .
