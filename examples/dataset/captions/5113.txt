The statistic represents global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions between 1975 and 2019 . Globally , 17.78 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide was emitted in relation to energy in 1980 . Energy-related emissions stabilized in 2019 when emissions reached 33.3 billion metric tons , following two consecutive years of increases in greenhouse gas emissions . Global carbon dioxide emissions â€“ additional informationIn 2016 , carbon dioxide emissions from fuel combustion totaled some 32.3 billion metric tons . The volume of global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions has steadily risen over the last decade , from 28.7 billion metric tons in 2009 to 33.3 billion metric tons in 2019 . However , the rate of increase has slowed down in the last few years , but has still reached a historic high in the last year . From 2013 to 2016 , there had been evidence of a global decoupling of greenhouse gas emissions from economic growth . It has been suggested that the immense addition of new renewable energy capacity has been critical for reducing emissions growth . In the recent past , a decrease or relatively unchanged volume of emissions has only been seen during economically weak periods , such as during the 2009 recession . Both the United States and China , two of the largest emitters in the world , registered a decrease in carbon dioxide emissions in 2015 . In China , a reduction in coal consumption has enabled an economic restructuring towards less energy-intensive industries and an emphasis on renewable resources . However , the decrease in emissions from these two countries was largely offset by other developing Asian countries and the Middle East , as well as increased emissions in Europe . Carbon dioxide emissions worldwide were primarily emitted by the Asia Pacific region , which reported more emissions in 2018 than North America ( 6.04 billion metric tons ) and Europe ( 4.21 billion metric tons ) combined .
