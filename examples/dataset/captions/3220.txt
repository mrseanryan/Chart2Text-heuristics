There are two procedures for reinsurance , facultative and treaty . Facultative reinsurance is when an insurance company buys insurance for a specific instance or occurrence . Treaty reinsurance covers a set of predetermined risks over a period of time . Facultative is seen as a one-time deal whereas treaty reinsurance is long term . There are several types of reinsurance which include proportional , non-proportional , risk attaching basis , losses occurring basis , and a claims-made basis .
