Some people complain that these days couples are not willing to invest in their relationship anymore , that the first hurdle encountered is a reason for a separation , and that â€˜ till death do us part ' does not really mean anything anymore . But whether that is true or not , facts show that people in the Netherlands continuously wait longer to file for a divorce . In the last decade , the average duration of marriage at the time of a divorce has increased by nearly a year , from 14.2 years in 2008 to 15 in 2018 . In the 1950s , this was even shorter . In 1950 , the average divorced couple had been married for 11.2 years before divorcing . Increasing divorce rate What also increased between the 1950s and today however was the number of marriage dissolutions . In this period , the number of divorces more than tripled , from three per 1,000 couples to just over nine in 2018 . That year , women on average were 44.3 years old when their marriage ended . Men were slightly older , at 47.6 years . Society and divorce Although segments of society still disapprove of divorcing , among a large share of the Dutch population getting a divorce is disappointing , but acceptable . A survey among the younger generation in the Netherlands in 2016 and 2017 found that over 80 percent of respondents thought it was sometimes necessary to end a marriage . Support was highest among the 26 to 34-year-olds , at 84 percent .
