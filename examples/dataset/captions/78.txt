Consumers were paying 139.83 Canadian dollars for 200 cigarettes , almost 30 dollars more than the national average retail price of 112.06 dollars for 200 cigarettes in the same month . Consumers could purchase 200 cigarettes for just 96.36 Canadian dollars in Canada 's largest province of Quebec . Why do prices vary regionally ? Smoking products are tightly regulated across Canada , with regulations and legal smoking ages varying between provinces . Tobacco taxes can be used to dissuade consumers from purchasing cigarettes , in order to reduce rates of smoking and related diseases . Canadian provinces have their own governmental budgets and , therefore , the power to implement their own tobacco taxes . This creates differences in prices across the country . Future growth in the Canadian tobacco marketRetail sales of tobacco products and supplies have steadily increased year on year , reaching an all-time high of 10.93 billion Canadian dollars in 2017 . May 2018 was a milestone month for the industry , with regulatory framework being passed to legalize the manufacturing and sale of vaping products in Canada .
