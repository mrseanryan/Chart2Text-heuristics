In 2018 , hip-hop and rap music accounted for 21.7 percent of total music consumption in the United States , more than double the percentage of R & B music sales . Other highly popular genres included pop and rock music , whereas just 1.1 percent of all music sold in the U.S. in 2018 was jazz . Why are some genres more popular than others ? Whilst music is a highly subjective medium in terms of the listener 's taste and preferences , the top genres in terms of consumption tend not to fluctuate heavily . The catchiness and familiarity of pop music is appealing to a wide range of music fans . Pop songs tend to be easy to listen to and remember , usually feature simple , snappy lyrics to avoid polarizing listeners , making pop overall less divisive than other genres because it is designed to generate mass appeal . Conversely , religious music by its very nature is a niche genre in that it encompasses , describes or advocates certain beliefs , giving it the equal ability to alienate some listeners while appealing enormously to others , depending on their religious stance . The hit genre of 2018 was hip-hop and rap , a music style notorious for its tendency to divide listeners . Singer Drake arguably influenced sales within the genre that year , with ‘ Scorpion ' topping the list of best-selling albums in the United States based on total streams and ‘ Scary Hours ' also making the top ten . Drake came tenth in the list of most successful music tours in North America , with revenue from his live concerts amounting to 79 million U.S. dollars , and second in the ranking was Jay-Z and Beyoncé with 166.4 million dollars in revenue , artists whose music is also strongly aligned with the rap and hip-hop genre . Other artists in the genre who achieved significant influence in 2018 include Kendrick Lamar , Childish Gambino , Cardi B , Travis Scott and Post Malone , many of whom released songs that year which garnered hundreds of millions of audio streams . The sheer amount of hip-hop and rap music flooding the music industry has had a profound effect on the genre 's popularity , and musicians in the category tend to be prolific songwriters and active social media users . Equally , artists in the genre are arguably passionate about creating music which challenges social norms in a way that rock music has always been famous for .
