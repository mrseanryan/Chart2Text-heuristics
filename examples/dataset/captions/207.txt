82 of the mass shootings in the United States between 1982 and February 2020 involved weapons which were obtained legally ; a clear majority . Only 16 incidents involved guns that were obtained illegally . Legally owned firearms in the U.S . Within the United States , one must be at least 18 years old in order to purchase shotguns , rifles , and ammunition , and at least 21 years old to purchase all other firearms . Some people may be restricted from owning firearms , such as individuals who have been dishonorably discharged from the military or tourists . Guns must be sold through licensed dealers , and purchasers must undergo a background check . However , the much-discussed `` gun show loophole '' allows people to purchase firearms from a flea market , gun show , online , or from a personal collector without a background check . The national firearm conversation The right to own a gun in the United States is protected by the 2nd Amendment of the Constitution . While changing a part of the Bill of Rights ( the first 10 amendments to the Constitution ) would be extremely difficult , the issue of gun rights has become a highly controversial , and highly partisan , topic in the national conversation . For example , a majority of Republicans believe that if legal gun ownership is controlled , that there will not be a difference in the number of mass shootings . In contrast , most Democrats believe the number will decrease .
