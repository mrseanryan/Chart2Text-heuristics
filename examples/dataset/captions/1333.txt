In 2005 , about 92.7 percent of the Mexican population was monolingual in Spanish . Around five percent spoke a combination of Spanish and indigenous languages . Spanish is the second-most spoken native language worldwide , after Mandarin Chinese . Mexican Spanish Spanish was first being used in Mexico in the 16th century , at the time of Spanish colonization during the Conquest campaigns of what is now Mexico and the Caribbean . As of 2018 , Mexico is the country with the largest number of native Spanish speakers worldwide . Mexican Spanish is influenced by English and Nahuatl , and has about 120 million users . The Mexican government uses Spanish in the majority of its proceedings , however it recognizes 68 national languages , 63 of which are indigenous . Indigenous languages spoken Of the indigenous languages spoken , two of the most widely used are Nahuatl and Maya . Due to a history of marginalization of indigenous groups , most indigenous languages are endangered , and many linguists warn they might cease to be used after a span of just a few decades . In recent years , legislative attempts such as the San Andr√©as Accords have been made to protect indigenous groups , who make up about 25 million of Mexico 's 125 million total inhabitants , though the efficacy of such measures is yet to be seen .
