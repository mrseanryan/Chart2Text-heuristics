There were around 372 new cases of measles in the U.S. in 2018 . Measles , also known as rubeola , is an infectious disease that is highly contagious and affects mostly children . Common symptoms of measles include fever , runny nose , sore throat , cough , and a rash . Although death rates from measles have decreased around the world , it is still responsible for around 91,000 deaths worldwide per year . Measles vaccination The main reason for the decrease in measles cases and deaths is due to high vaccination rates . The widely used MMR vaccine protects against measles , mumps , and rubella and is safe and effective . In 2017 , around 91.5 percent of children aged 19 to 35 months had received the MMR vaccine . However , in recent years there has been a rise in measles cases in many parts of the world due to vaccine hesitancy . Vaccine hesitancy Vaccine hesitancy refers to a refusal or reluctance to have children vaccinated despite the overwhelming evidence that vaccines are safe and effective . This hesitancy comes from a misunderstanding of the ingredients in vaccines and how they work , a mistrust of doctors and pharmaceutical companies , and belief in the unfounded associations of vaccines with other diseases and disorders . Shockingly , a recent survey from Statista found that only 71 percent of U.S. parents felt the measles vaccine was `` absolutely necessary '' .
