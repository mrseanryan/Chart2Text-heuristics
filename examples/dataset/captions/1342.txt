Kenya 's unemployment rate was 9.31 percent in 2019 . This represents a steady decline from the increase after the financial crisis , but pre-recession levels were still above 10 percent . What is unemployment ? The unemployment rate of a country refers to the share of people who want to work but can not find jobs . This includes workers who have lost jobs and are searching for new ones , workers whose jobs ended due to an economic downturn , and workers for whom there are no jobs because the labor supply in their industry is larger than the number of jobs available . Different statistics suggest which factors contribute to the overall unemployment rate . The Kenyan context The first type , so-called `` search unemployment '' , is hardest to see in the data . The closest proxy is Kenya 's inflation rate . As workers take new jobs faster , employers are forced to increase wages , leading to higher employment . Jobs lost due to economic downturns , called `` cyclical unemployment '' , can be seen by decreases in the GDP growth rate , which are not significant in Kenya . Finally , `` structural unemployment '' refers to workers changing the industry , or even economic sector , in which they are working . In Kenya , more and more workers switch to the services sector . This is often a result of urbanization , but any structural shift in the economy 's composition can lead to this unemployment .
