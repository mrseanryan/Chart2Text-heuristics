In 2018 , approximately 30.4 million people in the United States had no health insurance . The share of Americans without health insurance was steadily decreasing until 2015 , but has been increasing since 2017 . The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 caused this change , because it repealed the individual mandate , which penalized individuals for failing to maintain health coverage . Positive impact of Affordable Care Act In the U.S. there are public and private forms of health insurance , as well as social welfare programs such as Medicaid and programs just for veterans such as CHAMPVA . The Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) was enacted in 2010 , which dramatically reduced the number of uninsured Americans , though there 's still room for improvement . In spite of its success in providing more Americans with health insurance , ACA has had an almost equal number of proponents and opponents since its introduction , though the share of Americans in favor of it has risen since mid-2017 . Persistent disparity among ethnic groups The number of uninsured people is higher in certain demographic groups . For instance , Hispanics continue to be the ethnic group with the highest rate of uninsured people , even after ACA . Meanwhile the share of uninsured white people is still lower than the national average .
