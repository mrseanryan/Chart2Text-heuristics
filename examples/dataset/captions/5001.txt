With 60 percent of the market share , Engie Electrabel reached the highest market share of electricity supply in the Brussels-Capital Region . The Belgian daughter of the French multinational Engie was , therefore , leading the market in this region of Belgium in 2019 . Lampiris was the second-largest supplier , holding a market share of 19 percent . In Belgium , the major electricity providers were Engie Electrabel , Lampiris , and EDF-Luminus . Belgian electricity providers face regional differences Belgium is a country where regions and language communities have strong identities . The market for electricity suppliers is therefore different from one region to another , thus the share of providers on a national scale being nonsensical . From a regional perspective , Electrabel was leading the market in Wallonia and Flanders . However , Luminus was the second-largest provider in both regions , outcompeting Lampiris . In Flanders , the third-largest electricity provider was Eneco , further surpassing Lampiris . In 2018 , Belgium produced 74.6 terawatt-hours and registered an unstable production since 2001 . The price of electricity in the Brussels-Capital region In 2018 , the annual residential electricity bill reached 783 euros in the Brussels-Capital Region ( based on a consumption of 3.500 kWh from a single meter with a low-voltage network ) . However , the invoice was heftier in Wallonia and especially in Flanders , where it reached over a thousand euros . The inhabitants of the Brussels-Capital Region were , therefore , paying the least for their electricity compared to other parts of the country .
