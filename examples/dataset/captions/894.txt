Singapore posted a gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth rate of 3.7 percent in 2017 , after adjusting for inflation . While up from the previous two years , this number is expected to decline in 2018 , settling around 3.14 percent . What is GDP ? GDP is a measure of a country 's income , and most economists agree that slow but steady GDP growth is best for a developed economy . GDP measures the total value of all goods and services produced within a country during a certain time period . With the highest GDP per capita in ASEAN , Singapore certainly qualifies as developed , meaning that it should target GDP growth around 2 to 3 percent . Singapore 's context Singapore is a small , open economy . As such , it has little influence on , and high exposure to , international trends . For example , a shift in the exchange rate with a major trading partner can have significant effects on the economy . For Singapore , who relies heavily on exports , these kinds of shocks can affect the entire economy . For example , a weaker Singapore dollar would increase GDP by raising net exports , but this would also lead to higher inflation . As a result , policymakers in Singapore have to follow many factors if they want to continue enjoying healthy GDP growth .
