This statistic shows the national debt of Greece from 2014 to 2018 , with projections until 2024 . In 2018 , the national debt in Greece was around 375.74 billion U.S. dollars . In a ranking of debt to GDP per country , Greece is currently ranked second . Greece 's struggle after the financial crisis Greece is a developed country in the EU and is highly dependent on its service sector as well as its tourism sector in order to gain profits . After going through a large economic boom from the 1950s to the 1970s as well as somewhat high GDP growth in the early to mid 2000s , Greece 's economy took a turn for the worse and struggled intensively , primarily due to the Great Recession , the Euro crisis as well as its own debt crisis . National debt within the country saw significant gains over the past decades , however roughly came to a halt due to financial rescue packages issued from the European Union in order to help Greece maintain and improve their economical situation . The nation 's continuous rise in debt has overwhelmed its estimated GDP over the years , which can be attributed to poor government execution and unnecessary spending . Large sums of financial aid were taken from major European banks to help balance out these government-induced failures and to potentially help refuel the economy to encourage more spending , which in turn would decrease the country 's continuously rising unemployment rate . Investors , consumers and workers alike are struggling to see a bright future in Greece , whose chances of an economic comeback are much lower than that of other struggling countries such as Portugal and Italy . However , Greece 's financial situation might improve in the future , as it is estimated that at least its national debt will decrease - slowly , but steadily . Still , since its future participation in the European Union is in limbo as of now , these figures can only be estimates , not predictions .
