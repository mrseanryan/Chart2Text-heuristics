The statistic shows the numbers of earthquakes worldwide from 2000 to 2019 . In 2019 , a total of 1,637 earthquakes with magnitude of five or more were recorded worldwide . Additional information on the effects of earthquakes While the technology used to find the source of and record earthquakes has improved since the 20th century , the ability of scientists to predict earthquakes is still severely limited . As earthquakes happen numerous times every day , the issue for policy makers and city planners is n't if an earthquake will occur , but how powerful it will be . Large earthquakes generally result in higher death tolls in developing countries or countries where building codes are less stringent . China has suffered from a number of strong earthquakes that have resulted in extremely high death tolls . While earthquakes occur around the globe along the various tectonic plate boundaries , a significant proportion occur around the basin of the Pacific Ocean in what is referred to as the Ring of Fire due to the high degree of tectonic activity . Many of the countries in the Ring of Fire , including Japan , Chile , the United States and New Zealand , led the way in earthquake policy and science as a result . The tragic loss of life is not the only major negative effect of earthquakes , a number of earthquakes have caused billions of dollars worth of damage to infrastructure and private property . The high cost of damage in the 2011 Fukushima and Christchurch earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand respectively demonstrates that even wealthy , developed countries who are experienced in dealing with earthquakes are ill-equipped when the large earthquakes hit .
