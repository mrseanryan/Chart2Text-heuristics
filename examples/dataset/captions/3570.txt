In 2018/19 the number of overall crime offences in the United Kingdom reached approximately 6.3 million , an increase of around 430 thousand offences when compared with 2017/18 . Although crime figures were slightly higher in the early 2000s , they were far lower in 2013/14 , when just 4.4 million crimes were recorded in the UK . More with less The rise in crime witnessed during this period has led to serious questions about how to reverse this trend , and if the police have enough manpower and resources to counter it . Due to austerity measures pursued by British governments after 2010 , police forces were forced to cut officer numbers in successive years between 2010 and 2018 , resulting in a net decrease of over 20 thousand officers . While there was a slight increase in public sector expenditure on the police force in 2017/18 and 2018/19 , the 17.99 billion British pounds spent in the most recent year was still less than the 19.3 billion spent in 2009/10 . Crime rates higher in Northern England The three regions in England and Wales with the highest crime rate in this year were the North East , the North West and Yorkshire . London , the UK capital also had a relatively high crime rate of 98 crimes per 1,000 people while the South West of England had the lowest crime rate of 67.8 crimes per 1,000 people .
