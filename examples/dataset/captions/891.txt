More than half of the world 's population identify as feminists - in India alone , over 80 percent of respondents very much or somewhat agreed that they defined themselves as feminists . Surprisingly , this number is much lower in developed countries like the United States or Germany ( with not even 40 percent of respondents agreeing ) , which might be due to the bad reputation feminism - wrongfully – has . But are some really more equal than others ? Despite its deceptive title , feminism is not about establishing superiority of women – its core concept is equality for all , no matter their sex , gender , or orientation . Achieving this equality means championing women with more force and verve than has been done before , since today 's societies are deeply patriarchal – i.e . they favor men over women . Critics often misinterpret this support of women as an attempt to suppress and attack men – when in fact , feminism and equality for all benefits them as well . The country of the poets and thinkers seems stuck In Germany , feminism is on the rise , but traditional gender roles and insufficient information still hinder progress . Only a third of German women , and even fewer German men , define themselves as feminist , while at the same time , over 70 percent of women and almost 60 percent of men would agree that gender equality is important to them . Still , they are not convinced that discrimination against women is ending anytime soon . Most of all , they say , reallocating responsibility and adjusting payrolls would help to achieve a feminist society .
