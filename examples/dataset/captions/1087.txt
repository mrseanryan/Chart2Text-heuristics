Siemens AG has managed to increase its annual revenue from 2018 by three percent , meaning that annual revenue surpassed 86.8 billion euros in the 2019 fiscal year . Restructure and redirection Revenue grew in 2019 at Siemens in spite of a struggling power and gas division , which will be spun off by the end of 2020 . In fact , revenue from this division dropped from around 18 billion euros in 2018 to about 17.66 billion euros in 2019 . It is no surprise then that - when Siemens announced earlier that the power and gas division was to be spun off - shares for the company went up 5.5 percent . As is too often the case , the announcement about the spin-off was accompanied with that of job cuts . Over 10,000 employees in digital , infrastructure and corporate fields will be laid off in order to save cash . On the upside , some new positions were expected created , and employee figures rose from 377,000 in 2018 to 383,000 in 2019 .
