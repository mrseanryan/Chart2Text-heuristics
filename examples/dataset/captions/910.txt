In the past decade , Japan 's degree of urbanization has leveled off at around 91 percent . This means that less than 10 percent of Japan 's population of 126 million inhabitants do not live in an urban setting . Japan is well above the degree of urbanization worldwide , which is 55 percent . Japan is also known for its high population density : In 2017 , it amounted to an eye-watering 347.78 inhabitants per square kilometer - however , it is not even among the top twenty countries with the highest population density worldwide . That ranking is lead by Monaco , followed by China , and Singapore . Japan 's aging population The main demographic challenge that Japan currently faces is an aging population , as the number of inhabitants over 65 years old is an increasing percentage of the population . As of 2018 , Japan is the country with the largest percentage of total population over 65 years , and life expectancy at birth there is about 84 years . Simultaneously , the birth rate in Japan is declining , resulting in negative population growth in recent years . One method Japan is using to address these demographic shifts is by investing in automated work processes ; it 's one of the top countries interested in collaborative robots .
