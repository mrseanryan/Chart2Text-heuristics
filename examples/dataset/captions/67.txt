The statistic shows the twenty countries with the highest public debt in relation to GDP in 2019 . In 2019 , Japan ranked first among the countries with the highest public debt levels ; it had an estimated debt of around 237.69 percent of GDP.Japanese public debt Public debt , also known as national and government debt , is the debt owed by a nation 's central government . However , as a government draws in much of its income from its population , government debt is an indirect debt on taxpayers . The countries with the highest public debt are unsurprising , and although the United States ' debt is much vaster ; no nation in the world has a higher public debt in relation to GDP than Japan . The nation 's soaring debt is at around a quadrillion yen , roughly 10.5 trillion US dollars , and larger than the German , French and British economies combined . The Japanese government is currently spending around half of its total tax revenue on servicing its massive debt . Despite this , the yield on 10-year Japanese bonds remains at a surprisingly low level at under 1 percent . The Japanese have limited options available to them . A possibility could be to default on their debt ; this would probably result in a renegotiation of the interest rate and the length of the loan of the principal payments . At present , however , Japan has decided to try and inflate its debt away and have begun to implement the greatest QE experiment attempted by any nation . The Bank of Japan plans to print money to the value of around 60 trillion yen and use it to buy government bonds . The Japanese government is counting on investors to buy up its bonds , despite the fact that the nation plans to almost double its monetary base , effectively halving the purchasing power . For the moment , it seems to be working , but a change in attitudes on the part of the buyers and an increase in interest rates could have catastrophic repercussions for Japan .
