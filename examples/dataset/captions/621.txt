In 2018 , there were approximately 1.2 million insurance agents , brokers and service employees in the United States . The insurance industry and employment The number of the U.S. insurance brokers , agents and service employees has remained relatively stable during the difficult period that followed the recession of 2008 and the period of financial insecurity that ensued , and , to some extent , remains to this day . This is consistent with the general acceptance of the fact that the insurance industry is fairly recession-proof . Insurance companies tend to be conservative in a fiscal sense , and regardless of what the economy is doing , people need insurance . A further benefit which allows insurance companies a relatively high level of independence is the fact that they are generally mutual insurance companies , which answer to policy holders rather than to Wall Street . This is not to say , however , that the industry is immune to the effects of the economic situation around it . If gas prices rise , for example , consumers may decide not to buy the second car they had been thinking about , or the house extension they had been planning . This , in turn , means fewer policies sold by the insurance companies . At the same time , crime levels generally tend to rise in a period of recession , meaning higher claims made and higher payouts made by the insurance company . The economic situation and the insurance industry are reliant on one another and both require each other in one way or another for prosperity and stability . People may not think of the insurance industry as the most glamorous opportunity for employment , but employment levels have been steadily rising in the industry .
