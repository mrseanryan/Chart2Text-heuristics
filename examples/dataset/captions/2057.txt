The average for the studied countries amounted to 0.95 U.S. dollars . The United States placed slightly above the global average , with CPC valued at 1.1 U.S. dollars . Facebook CPCCPCs vary depending on the advertising campaign 's objective . If the aim is as simple as gaining post engagement , then CPCs are the least expensive . However , the more complex the objective , the higher the cost-per-click gets . The most expensive is app installs , which means that advertisers need to pay 0.3 U.S. dollars per click that leads to customers installing apps , compared to 0.02 U.S. dollars for post engagement . Brand awareness , page likes , reach and conversions are in the middle of the spectrum . All in all , after a spike in advertising costs in third quarter of 2017 , when Facebook CPCs grew by 282 percent year-on-year , the company 's ad rates were being increasingly lowered thanks to their improved targeting and growing engagement .
