In 2011 , the country 's economy experienced higher than average annual growth , which most likely helped increase consumer confidence and may have correlated with a decrease in the inflation rate . In general , consumer confidence is rising because GDP per capita has also been increasing steadily and is expected to continue to do so in the future . However , living conditions of Nicaraguans are still far from ideal , and the country struggles to overcome its reputation as one of the poorest nations in the region . GDP per capita in Nicaragua remained under 2,000 U.S. dollars per capita in 2014 ; only a fraction of GDP for Latin America and the Caribbean as a whole , which was slightly over 10,000 U.S. dollars per capita that same year .
