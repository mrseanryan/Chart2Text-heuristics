The number of hospitals in Germany has been decreasing every year , amounting to 1,942 in 2017 . In comparison , there were 2,242 hospitals in 2000 . The number of hospital beds has been dropping also , from 571,600 in 2000 to 497,200 recorded in 2017 . Hospital reform While there can be many reasons for a hospital closing , in Germany most of them have to do with the so-called ongoing hospital reform ( Krankenhausreform ) or the hospital structure law ( Krankenhausstrukturgesetz ) . A summary of explanations from the government involves falling rural inhabitant numbers , which may lead to rural hospitals closing , and an aging population in general , therefore making it a necessity to check hospitals for being up-to-date in terms of equipment , staff and availability . Future remains to be seen On a positive note , statutory health insurance spending on hospital treatments in Germany has been increasing during the last decade , covering almost 75 million euros in 2017 . The long-term effects of the hospital reform remain to be seen , as opening a new hospital after a closing , deciding on locations in rural areas , refurbishing working hospitals and hiring staff takes time and resources .
