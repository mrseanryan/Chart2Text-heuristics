At the beginning of 2017 , 70 percent of consumers with an online video or music subscription confirmed that they had an active Netflix subscription at the time of survey . Millennials and Gen-Xers were more likely to have a Netflix subscription than their older peers , which comes as no surprise given that Netflix is considered the most indispensable TV and video source among consumers aged between 16 to 34 years old . One of the most appealing aspects of Netflix for viewers is the availability of original content , which has fast become one of the keys to the company 's success . Netflix and original content Netflix is the leading video subscription service in the United States with more than double the number of subscribers of competitors Hulu and Amazon , and also boasts a far larger catalogue of original content . This new trend of creating original shows and movies does not come cheap – Netflix 's video content budget grew five times in as many years and is predicted to increase even more in the future . In 2018 , the company 's content budget amounted to a cool 12 billion U.S. dollars , over three billion more than in the previous year . Whilst reviews of Netflix 's original shows can be mixed , the platform is now known for several wildly popular titles including ‘ Orange is the New Black ' _ , ‘ Stranger Things ' _ , ‘ House of Cards ' and ‘ The Crown ' _ . Moreover , during the same five year period in which Netflix ramped up its content spend , its original content titles won and were nominated for several Golden Globe awards , Emmys and even Oscars – a huge achievement for a company with its origins in the DVD-by-mail market . Netflix is not showing any signs of slowing its original content production down . A brief Google search reveals multiple articles detailing extensive release schedules and upcoming titles for viewers to get excited about , and it looks like the company 's millions of subscribers will have many more original titles to look forward to , binge watch and tweet about in years to come .
