This statistic shows the gross domestic product ( GDP ) in Italy from 1984 to 2018 , with projections up until 2024 . GDP refers to the total market value of all goods and services that are produced within a country per year . It is an important indicator of the economic strength of a country . In 2018 , the GDP in Italy was about 2.08 trillion U.S. dollars . See global GDP for a global comparison . Italy 's economy After increasing significantly year-over-year , Italy 's gross domestic product ( GDP ) has gone through several fluctuations since the global economic crisis in 2008 . The European Union 's third largest economy has experienced downturns , primarily due to inefficiency with regards to spending and incompetent leadership . When analyzing the country 's budget balance , which is essentially the overall difference between revenues and spending , Italy has posted a negative balance , or a state deficit , every year over the past decade . However , their budget balance has improved noticeably every year since 2009 . Since the country spent more than they earned , national debt continued to rise every year , most notably between 2008 and 2009 , and continued to do so going into 2014 . Italy 's dependency on funding from other countries will lead to further debt , unless it finds a way to decrease spending or increase revenues . Despite the country 's ongoing recession , Italy 's GDP ranked the country in the top 10 countries with the largest gross domestic product in 2014 , ahead of economically developed countries such as Canada and Australia . This implies that Italy 's economical struggles are more a result of inefficient spending rather than a lack of production .
