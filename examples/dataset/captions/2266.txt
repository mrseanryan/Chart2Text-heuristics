In 2018 , Seat topped the list of most passenger cars registrations in Spain . The Spanish car brand saw the number of registrations amounting to over 107 thousand in 2018 . The most registered SEAT models were SEAT Leon and SEAT Ibiza , both exceeding 30 thousand registrations during 2018 . Germany : Europe â€˜ s indisputable car manufacturer Second in this list is Volkswagen . The German car manufacturer VW Group held the largest market share of passenger cars in Europe as of February 2019 , taking up 24.4 percent of the total market . Moreover , Germany was the European country that most recorded passenger car registrations , with nearly 4 million new cars on the country 's roads in 2017 . The popularity of cars in Germany comes as no surprise , since the European country houses a few of the largest automobile groups in the continent .

This is particularly visible in the preferred type of engine that the Europeans tended to acquire in recent years . Sales of diesel models have been recording a downtrend since 2013 in all European countries , presumably explained by the 2015 diesel scandal and subsequent discussions surrounding health and environmental impacts of the fuel type .
