The load factor of electricity from solar photovoltaics has seen an overall increase since 2010 , amounting to 11.3 percent in 2018 . However , this was a minor decrease from the previous year and significantly lower when compared to the load factors of other renewable sources . This can be explained by the lack of consistency in the number of sunny days recorded . In comparison , the load factor for offshore wind reached 39 percent . Capacity and generation In the same year , solar PV accounted for 29.6 percent of the total renewable capacity . However , its share of renewable electricity generation was just 11.7 percent . This was due to the relatively low load factor . In 2010 , electricity generated by solar PV amounted to 41 gigawatt-hours . By 2017 this had increased to more than 11,500 gigawatt-hours . Turnover and employment drop In 2017 the UK 's solar PV industry reported a turnover of 1.3 billion euros . This was a decrease of more than one billion euros compared to the previous year . As turnover decreased , so did employment figures . In 2016 there were approximately 29,000 employees in the sector , but the following year this number dropped by more than half due to cuts to subsidies .
