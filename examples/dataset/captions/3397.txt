China is the world 's most populous country . Its rapid economic development over the past decades has profited greatly from its large labor market . While the overall conditions for Chinese labor force are improving , the size of labor market in China is shrinking . And since the aging population is increasing and few children were born in the country , the share of employed people in the population of China keeps decreasing ; the unemployment rate was 65.2 percent in 2019 . Economic slowdown - impact on labor market After decades of rapid development , the world 's second largest economy now seems to have obstacles to boosting its economy further . The growth rate of GDP reached new record low and the number of employed people decreased for the first time in the last decade in 2018 . Under the influence of the global economic downturn and the US-China trade war , many Chinese enterprises engaged in international trade are having tough times , which leads to a recession in China 's labor market . Chances for better employment situation After numerous discussions , it 's still not clear if the United States and China would sign any trade deal in the next months . The long-lasting trade war has caused China great loss on its international trade sector , which has been driving China 's economic growth for decades . However , there is also a lot China could learn . First , the potential of domestic demands should be further developed and satisfied with high-quality products . Second , it 's good timing to eliminate backward industries with low value-added . And the high-tech and environment-friendly industries should be further promoted . In addition , China 's market can be more open to services , especially in the financial sector and IT services to attract more foreign investors . Highly skilled talents should be better valued in the labor market . Efficient vocational education and further education could also help change the structure of China ' labor market .
