In January 2020 , iron ore was valued at approximately 95.76 U.S. dollars per dry metric ton unit ( dmtu ) , as compared to 76.16 U.S. dollars per dmtu in January 2019 . Iron ore price and production Iron ore refers to the minerals and rocks from which metallic iron is economically viable to extract . Pig iron , which is one of the raw materials used in steel production , is derived from iron ore . The price of iron ore has fluctuated a great deal in the last thirteen years . In 2003 , one dmtu of iron ore cost 30 U.S. dollars , and increased to a high of 168 U.S. dollars per dmtu in 2011 . The price has seen dramatic drops in the past decade , from 139.87 U.S. dollars per dry metric ton unit in March 2013 to a recent low of 40.50 U.S. dollars per dmtu in December 2015 . Since then , the price has increased gradually to 95.76 U.S. dollars per dmtu as of January 2020 . Overall , the global production of iron ore has not decreased since the prices have dropped . In fact , an increase in production among the world 's largest iron ore producing countries was observed in the past five years . Australia produced 930 million metric tons of iron ore in 2019 , an increase of 156 million metric tons over the country 's 2014 production . China is also one of the world 's largest iron ore producers , though its production is calculated differently than in other countries . Based primarily on the production of raw ore rather than usable ore , China produced an estimated 350 million metric tons in 2019 , a notable decrease from 1.45 billion metric tons produced in 2013 .
