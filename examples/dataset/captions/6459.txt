Despite the government 's ban on Sunday trading , the situation of retail chains is not as dramatic as expected . In 2019 , 242 retail chains were operating in Poland , the largest share of which belonged to the clothing and footwear , furniture , and food sectors . Retail sales in Poland Retail sales volume in Poland have fluctuated but remained at six percent since 2015 . Growing incomes of Poles and social programs introduced by the government for Polish families are driving consumption . As a result , Poles are spending more and more money on shopping every year . In 2018 , retail sales amounted to a record of 862 billion zloty . However , growing market demand increases the risk of product price growth . Inflation in Poland is expected to reach 2.5 percent in 2020 , although financiers ' calculations predict a much higher level of price growth . In December 2019 , product prices rose by 3.4 percent year-on-year , with food and non-alcoholic beverages showing the most significant increases . Favorite retail stores of Poles According to profits generated in 2018 , the largest retail chain in Poland is Jeronimo Martins , owner of the retail chain Biedronka . However , in the ranking of favorite stores , Biedronka occupies quite a distant position . It turns out that Poles appreciate shopping in the Rossman , Nike , or Lidl chains more , the latter of which is a direct competition for Biedronka .
