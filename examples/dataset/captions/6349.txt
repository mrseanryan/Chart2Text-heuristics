This statistic shows the moral stance of Americans regarding sexual intercourse between an unmarried man and an unmarried woman as of 2018 . During the survey , 69 percent of respondents stated that they think sex between unmarried partners is morally acceptable . The moral acceptance of social issues in the US More than two thirds of respondents to a survey in the United States responded that they believe that sex between an unmarried man and woman is morally acceptable , while one third believed that it is morally wrong and only 1 percent stated that it is not a moral issue . Unsurprisingly , when posing the same question to respondents of the Mormon faith , a significantly higher percentage stated they believed that premarital sex is morally wrong . Regarding other morally acceptable or unacceptable actions , divorce had an acceptance rate of 71 percent among the American population , and the use of birth control was deemed acceptable â€“ remarkably higher than the acceptance rates for premarital sex . In the United States , the likelihood of divorce after the first marriage is at about 41 percent , and proportionally higher the more times one gets hitched ; and it is increasingly more accepted than it has been in the past . Interestingly , the 2015 results for premarital sex acceptance in the United States are quite different from the results of a similar survey back in 2013 , conducted globally , in which 36 percent of respondents in the United States said that premarital sex is not a moral issue , only 29 percent responded that it was acceptable and 30 percent stated it was unacceptable . The country with the least acceptance was Pakistan , where no one responded that premarital sex was acceptable . This is not surprising when taking into account that Pakistan is an Islamic Republic . In contrast , the Czech Republic had the highest acceptance rates , a country with one of the largest atheist populations worldwide .
