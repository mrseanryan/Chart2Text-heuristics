In 2018 , Luxembourg 's ArcelorMittal was ranked as the world 's largest steel producer . ArcelorMittal produced around 96 million metric tons worth of crude steel that year . The importance of steel Not only is steel one of the most common metal alloys , but it is also one of the most extensively applied materials , particularly in shipbuilding and car manufacturing , as well as building construction and infrastructure development . In an effort to save cost and make the energy-thirsty steel industry more environmentally benign , steel scrap is collected from waste streams , wrecked automobiles , dismantled buildings or other industrial sources and is melted into new products . Steel has one of the highest recycling rates among metals . Difficult times Beginning in 2009 , the steel industry has been experiencing challenging years including the upheaval in the U.S. financial markets , slowing construction spending in China in tandem with a glut of Chinese steel , political instability in Russia and Ukraine , growing trade tensions between the United States and trade partners , as well as the eurozone sovereign debt crisis . It is expected that 2021 will see moderate recovery in worldwide steel demand .
