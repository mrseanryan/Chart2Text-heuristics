The statistic presents the value of personal savings in the United States from 1960 to 2019 , as of last quarter of each year . The personal savings in the United States amounted to roughly 1.29 trillion U.S. dollars in 2019 . Personal savings in the United States It is generally the case that in times of austerity people hold on to capital . In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis , this has also been the case . The periods of growth and seeming economic stability in the pre-2008 crisis period were due to falling savings rates and growing household debt . People were confident the good times would stay and felt comfortable in borrowing money . Interest rates were low and credit was easily accessible and widely available - these factors encouraged people to spend money . United States consumers pushed growth at home and abroad . According to McKinsey & Company , consumers in the United States have accounted for more than three-quarters of US GDP growth since the year 2000 and for more than one-third of worldwide growth in private consumption since 1990 . These trends were fuelled by the surge in household debt and spendthrift . When people change their habits in the opposite direction the economic benefits of consumer spending go into reverse . People start trying to reduce their indebtedness , spend less and save more , consumption inevitably tumbles . An increase in saving means a decrease in spending , this equates to a serious drag for any economy . The value of personal savings in the United States in 2007 amounted to 296.5 billion U.S. dollars . After the 2008 crisis the savings increased to over 600 billion U.S. dollars and reached a high of almost 1.3 trillion U.S. dollars in 2012 before falling significantly to just over 926 billion U.S. dollars in 2016 - although savings rates again climbed to just below 1.3 trillion U.S. dollars in 2019 .
