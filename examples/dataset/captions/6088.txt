In 2018 , Trentino-South Tyrol was the region in Italy with the highest birth rate nationwide , with nine births per every 1,000 inhabitants . The following three positions of the ranking were occupied by Southern regions : Campania , Sicily , and Calabria . Indeed , South-Italy was the macro-region with the largest birth-rate in Italy . Population change in Italy Over the last years , the natural increase in population dropped and the number of deaths exceeded the number of births . This phenomenon can be observed in every region of the country , except in Trentino-South Tyrol , the only area in which the number of births was slightly higher than those of deaths in 2018 . Consequently , on a national scale the share of people aged over 65 years and over grew constantly , whereas the young population declined over the last decade . Certainly , the median age is increasing as well . Between 2011 and 2018 , the average median age ranged from 43.6 years to 45.2 years . High lifespans for Italians Another factor that contributes in making the population older is that people are living longer than ever before . Data about life expectancy reveal that the expected lifespan at birth is steadily rising : in 2018 , it stood at 80.8 years for men and 85.2 years for women . In fact , lifespans in Italy are one of the highest worldwide , even above the European average .
