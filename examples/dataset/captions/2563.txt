This statistic displays the number of offshore oil rigs worldwide as of January 2018 , by operator . At that point , Saudi Aramco operated 44 offshore rigs all over the world , and thus was the second-largest offshore oil drilling company by rig fleet worldwide . Offshore oil drilling companies As offshore oil production in the world 's shallow water deposits ( depths of less than 400 meters ) has become increasingly exhausted , deepwater ( depths of up to 1500 meters ) and even ultra-deepwater ( depths of more than 1500 meters ) oil drilling projects have become more common and more necessary . In the first half of 2016 , a total of 31 deepwater oil discoveries were made . Nevertheless , they are more expensive to develop than shallow water deposits and in the wake of the oil glut , many offshore oil projects have ceased to be viable . Many oil companies have decreased their offshore drilling activity significantly , and oil platform decommissioning activity has increased . Less than half of the companies engaged in offshore drilling worldwide had only one rig in operation as of January 2018 , where 78 companies out of a total of 139 offshore oil companies fell into this category . Pemex , short for Petr√≥leos Mexicanos , had the most offshore drilling rigs worldwide in January 2016 , at 49 rigs . Petrobras , a Brazilian multinational energy corporation , had the second-highest number of offshore oil rigs at that time , at 42 . It is not surprising that one third of the global capital expenditures on deepwater oil and gas projects between 2010 and 2014 was spent in Latin America , as both of these companies are based in that region .
