How much is minimum wage ? The federally mandated minimum wage in the United States is 7.25 U.S. dollars per hour , although the minimum wage varies from state to state . As of January 1 , 2020 , the District of Columbia had the highest minimum wage in the U.S. , at 14 U.S. dollars per hour . This was followed by Washington state , which had 13.5 U.S. dollars per hour as the state minimum wage . Minimum wage workers Minimum wage jobs are traditionally seen as `` starter jobs '' in the U.S. , or first jobs for teenagers and young adults , and the number of people working minimum wage jobs has decreased from almost four million in 1979 to about 434,000 in 2018 . However , the number of workers earning less than minimum wage in 2018 was significantly higher , at almost 1.3 million . Minimum wage jobs Minimum wage jobs are primarily found in food preparation and serving occupations , as well as sales jobs ( primarily in retail ) . Because minimum wage has not increased with inflation , and because the federal minimum wage has not been raised since 2009 , it is becoming harder and harder for minimum wage workers to afford essential things like rent with one minimum wage job .
