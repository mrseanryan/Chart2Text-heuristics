The graph shows the population growth in China from 2000 to 2017 . In 2017 , annual population growth in China amounted to about 0.6 percent . Declining population growth in China Due to strict birth control measures by the Chinese government as well as changing family and work situations of the Chinese people , population growth has subsided over the past decades . In the last ten years , the annual population growth ranged at around 0.5 percent , although the gradual abolition of the one-child policy from 2014 on led to temporarily higher birth figures . As of 2017 , leading countries in population growth could almost exclusively be found on the African continent and the Arabian Peninsula . Nevertheless , as of mid 2018 , Asia ranked first by a wide margin among the continents in terms of absolute population . Future development of Chinese populationThe Chinese population will soon reach a maximum size and then begin to shrink gradually . However , the exact year for this turning point is unclear . Whereas IMF estimates see it coming in the first half of the 2020s , Chinese demographers expect a later date around 2030 . As of 2018 , China still ranked the world 's most populous country , but India followed closely and will soon take over . Apart from the receding population growth , a clear growth trend in Chinese cities is visible . By 2018 , nearly 60 percent of Chinese people lived in urban areas , compared to less than 40 percent in 2002 .
