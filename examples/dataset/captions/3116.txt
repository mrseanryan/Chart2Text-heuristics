Berlin-based online fashion retailer Zalando is one of the fastest-growing companies not just in Germany , but in Europe . While its active customer base expands with each year , Zalando 's annual net income suffered a major blow in the financial year 2018 , going from 101.6 million to 51.2 million euros between 2017 and 2018 . A great turnaround in 2014 Zalando delivered its sunniest results in 2015 , when its net income equaled 121.5 million euros as displayed in this chart . After four consecutive years of loss , Zalando 's online fashion business flourished , which was helped by the company 's foray into various European markets . Not just online Besides its primary online business , Zalando also sells its products in its brick-and-mortar stores `` Zalando Outlets '' in five locations across Germany . Keen on bridging online and physical retail , the company announced later in 2018 that more Zalando Outlet stores in different German cities were on their way to meet customers .
