The District of Columbia had the highest robbery rate in the United States in 2017 , with 343.8 robberies per 100,000 inhabitants . The lowest robbery rate in the country was found in Vermont , with 11.2 robbers per 100,000 inhabitants . Crime in the District of Columbia The violent crime rate in the District of Columbia was also the highest in the country in 2018 , and there are a few reasons for this : Firstly , the population of the District of Columbia is quite low ( causing a higher rate of crime ) , and secondly , issues such as the crack epidemic of the 1990s exacerbated the prevalence of crime in the District . As rising rents and gentrification force more people out of the District , crime is moving into neighboring Maryland and Virginia suburbs , as poorer residents seek more affordable living conditions . Crime in the United States Overall , violent crime in the United States and the District of Columbia today is far below the violent crime rate of the 1990s . While some may feel that crime is on the rise , due in part to media sensationalism , in fact the opposite is true , and the United States are becoming safer over time .
