With each player taking home a handsome 7.77 million U.S. dollars every year , the NBA is the professional sports league with the highest player wages worldwide . In second place is the Indian Premier League , an annual cricket competition contested each year between eight franchises representing eight different Indian cities . Big money in the NBA Although the wages that players in the NBA take home are astronomical , the average annual salaries vary greatly from team to team . Whilst the Atlanta Hawks pay their players an average of 5.22 million U.S. dollars a year , Oklahoma City Thunder spent almost double that , with each of their stars taking home 10.33 million U.S. dollars annually . The top player on Oklahoma 's wage bill is point guard , Russell Westbrook , who takes home an annual salary of 35.7 million U.S. dollars . It seems that the club 's investment in their prized possession has paid off , as Westbrook is the Thunder 's all-time leading points scorer . NBA salary cap It may be surprising to hear that , although NBA players take home sky-high wages , there is actually a salary cap in place in the league . This cap limits the total money that teams can spend on their players in order to keep the playing field as level as possible . The salary cap in the 2018/19 season reached almost 102 million U.S. dollars per team , a considerable increase from the cap of just over 58 million U.S. dollars in the 2012/13 season .
