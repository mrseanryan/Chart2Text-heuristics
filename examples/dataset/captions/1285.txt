In 2019 , Barnes & Noble had 627 stores in the United States , three fewer than in the previous year . The company had 726 locations all across the country back in 2008 , however this figure has been decreasing ever since , with the sharpest drop recorded between 2012 and 2013 . Barnes & Noble has had a patchy few years in terms of its profitability and reported a net loss of almost 125.5 million U.S. dollars in 2018 , followed by net income of just 3.77 million in 2019 . The company has also drastically reduced its number of employees , replacing full-time workers earning an annual salary with part-time staff on lower wages . Barnes & Noble and beyond : a changing market The dwindling presence of physical bookstores in the U.S. is often blamed solely on Amazon . However , Barnes & Noble 's focus on expanding its repertoire beyond just books ( including the launch of several restaurants within its stores ) has led to consumers and news publications alike questioning precisely what the retailer has become and how it intends to move forward . In June 2019 , it was announced that investment firm Elliot Management Corporation would acquire Barnes & Noble for a sum of more than 680 million U.S. dollars , just over a year after purchasing a majority stake in British book chain Waterstones . The situation for bookstores in the United Kingdom is similar to those in the U.S. â€“ despite Waterstones ranking as one of the most popular retail brands in the UK , this popularity does not necessarily translate into sales and the company has struggled to keep up . E-commerce has had a profound effect on brick and mortar stores in general , but whilst plenty of consumers still prefer to purchase many products instore , when it comes to books this is not always the case . A 2019 study in the U.S. revealed that books are most commonly purchased via a third-party marketplace , with 42 percent of survey respondents stating that they had purchased books from third-party online sellers in the past year . Third-party marketplaces were more popular for buying books than any other product type , and books were among the least likely products to be purchased in a physical store . Perhaps unsurprisingly , books were also among the leading product categories purchased by Amazon shoppers . In a market where monthly retail sales of U.S. bookstores are prone to serious seasonal changes and rarely surpass 700 million dollars , chains like Barnes & Noble look to have a difficult future ahead of them .
