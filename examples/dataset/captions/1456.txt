The United Kingdom spent approximately 4.56 billion British pounds on its prison system in 2018/19 , an increase when compared to the previous year . Despite this , the United Kingdom is still spending around 40 million pounds less than it did in 2010/11 , due mainly to the austerity policies pursued by the coalition Government of the time.Decline in officer numbers As of March 2019 , there were around 22.63 thousand prison officers working in England and Wales , a seven-year high and an increase of 1.59 thousand people from 2016/17 . The number of prison officers has naturally followed a similar pattern to the levels of funding provided by the government , so as funding fell after 2010 , so too did officer numbers . Rise in assaults The fall in officer numbers and funding precipitated a steep rise in the number of assaults in prisons . In 2017 there were over 29 thousand assaults among prisoners , and a further 8.4 thousand assaults on prison staff in England and Wales . Just a few years earlier in 2014 , there were 16.2 thousand assaults among prisoners and 3.6 thousand attacks on staff .
