Perhaps unsurprisingly , British rock band The Beatles are top of the list for best-selling artists worldwide , with 257.7 million certified sales . Second is Elvis Presley with almost 207 million sales , followed by Michael Jackson with 169.7 million . All the artists who made the top twenty list are internationally renowned for their contributions to music and range from Canadian singer Celine Dion to American singer-songwriter Garth Brooks . What do the top-selling artists have in common ? The artists in the top twenty ranking for worldwide certified sales all made their mark in music in their own unique way . However , what is notable is that many of the artists in the list achieved fame and success several decades ago and were fortunate enough to have a lasting impact . Most of the musicians in the list were born in the United States or the United Kingdom and began their musical career in the 1960s or 1970s . The music of the 1960s is often considered revolutionary , with politically-minded music from the likes of Bob Dylan and Joan Baez achieving huge popularity and psychedelic rock becoming one of the musical hallmarks of the era . British psychedelic/progressive rock band Pink Floyd as well as rock groups The Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin all formed in London in the 1960s , as well as The Beatles who began their career in Liverpool at the beginning of the decade . Which artists are still active today ? As of early 2019 , only a few of the artists who made the list remain active . American band the Eagles have toured regularly throughout their long career , as well as Irish group U2 . Rihanna , the youngest artist by far to make the top twenty ranking , continues to make and play music as well as exploring other avenues such as acting and fashion . Sadly though , several of the world 's top-selling musicians have now passed , including Elvis Presley , Whitney Houston and Michael Jackson . Certain groups are still musically active but few have retained their original line-up â€“ namely Queen who have continued to play since the death of front man Freddie Mercury in 1991 . Australian rock and roll band AC/DC have undergone multiple line-up changes over the years , the most recent being the replacement of vocalist Brian Johnson with Guns n ' Roses singer Axl Rose .
