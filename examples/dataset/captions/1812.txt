The statistic presents the most costly insurance losses worldwide from 1970 to 2017 . It was found that hurricane Katrina , hitting the United States and Gulf of Mexico in 2005 , was the most expensive disaster since 1970 , as it incurred insured losses amounting to approximately 82.39 billion U.S. dollars . Insuring against natural disasters Insuring is the practice of transferring risk from one entity to another in exchange for payment . It is important , especially if one lives , owns property or a business in an area prone to natural disasters , to take out coverage for a range of storms , catastrophic events and natural disasters that could cause damage to real estate . When considering this type of insurance it is important to ask a lot of the important questions up front . How long will it take for a claim to be settled for example , not all insurers settle claims with the same speed . Many also provide specific exclusions , be they for floods , earthquakes or other types of natural events . A detailed inspection of exclusions in a policy is important in order to find out which coverage is still needed . Obviously , the extent of coverage that one should take out is wholly dependant on the area in which one lives , in the United States , as well as in the rest of the world , there are low risk areas and there are high risk areas . Despite this , no one can be sure where a natural disaster will occur and the severity of the destruction it could bring with it when it does , no one can stop natural disasters or the economic impact that they have but insurance helps to mitigate the loss caused by them .
