The price of solar photovoltaic modules in the United States has seen a fairly consistent decrease over the last few years . In Q3 2019 , module prices averaged 0.31 U.S. dollars per watt , in comparison to 0.63 U.S. dollars per watt in Q1 2016 . Solar system pricing has fallen in all markets , including residential , non-residential , and utility markets . The decline is largely due to declining hardware costs , primarily from lower module prices . The oversupply of modules due to decreasing demand from China lowered module prices ; in turn , this has helped to alleviate the tariffs that were implemented on Chinese module exports to the United States . Solar price variations Prices of solar photovoltaics are consistently low in the United States , in comparison to many other countries . The price of solar can also vary within each U.S. state , mostly due to the cost of electricity . The components that are used in solar energy systems may also impact the price of solar photovoltaics . Falling global demand , high supply levels , and the resulting bidding competition have also pushed prices lower .
