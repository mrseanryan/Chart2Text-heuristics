The unemployment rate in Singapore fell to around 3.62 percent in 2019 from 3.77 percent in the year before . For many economies , this would be considered overemployment , but Singapore may have a lower natural unemployment rate than other economies . What 's wrong with overemployment ? When there are not enough workers , firms are forced to hire anyone who is available . This means that employers may not select the best applicants but rather anyone who applies . This leads to lower productivity , because workers are not finding the job for which they are best suited . Companies may also have to offer wages that are so high that they also lead to a rise in prices and thus , to a higher inflation . Singapore may be different Singapore has a small , open economy . It has the highest gross domestic product ( GDP ) per capita in the region , indicating that it is an advanced economy . This is largely due to the small population , which is almost entirely urban . As such , its workforce may be better matched to employer needs , which would reduce the natural level of unemployment .
