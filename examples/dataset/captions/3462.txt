There are a few countries around the world who have encouraged the penetration of wind energy into their electrical grids . For example , wind penetration in Denmark exceeded 40 percent , while wind generation in Ireland , Germany , and Portugal reached between 20 to 30 percent of their total electricity generation in 2018 . Wind energy penetration reached only about 6.5 percent in comparison , although the United States has installed the most wind power in the world , second only to China . Global wind technologiesCumulatively , there has been about 597 gigawatts of wind power capacity installed around the world . The installed wind energy capacity is expected to continue to increase in the near future as the levelized cost of electricity from wind technologies decreases . The majority of wind energy installations is land-based ( onshore ) , while the rest are offshore installations . Onshore wind transmission and distribution infrastructure tends to be less expensive and is one of the most competitive renewable technologies on the market . Offshore wind is still a budding technology in comparison to the well-established onshore technologies . However , offshore wind tends to be more efficient due to more consistent wind speeds and directions .
