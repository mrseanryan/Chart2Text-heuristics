The total average hospital bill for U.S. births varies depending on the kind of birth . In 2013 , the average cost of an uncomplicated vaginal birth was around 32 thousand U.S. dollars . For a standard Cesarean section birth the cost was near 51 thousand U.S. dollars at that time . Cesarean sections are performed via the surgical removal of an infant from the mother . Birth costs The United States has one of the highest birthing costs in the world . The average hospital and physician costs for a normal vaginal delivery in the United States may cost twice as much as a normal vaginal birth in Australia . Cesarean sections costs are more expensive than vaginal births , but the cost difference is similar . The United States , followed by Switzerland , had the highest costs among select countries for C-section deliveries . Birth rates and mother 's ageThe birth rate in the United States has decreased dramatically in recent history . Some evidence suggests that birth rates may be impacted by family income . According to recent data , lower incomes have higher birth rates in the United States . Birth rates were highest among women aged 20 to 34 years . However , there is an increasing tendency of mothers being older at the time of their first birth .
