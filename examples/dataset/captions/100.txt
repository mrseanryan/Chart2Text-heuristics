Lack of good medical conditions which include access to vaccines , antibiotics and a balanced nutrition are most common in thirds world countries . As a result , the infant mortality rates in African countries such as Niger and Mali are also amongst the highest . Nowadays , a large population growth in a country is either associated with a poor economy , lack of awareness and preventive measures or poor living conditions . Lack of access to birth control and contraception in third world countries also contributes to higher fertility rates . The global population is around 7 billion people and the African continent makes up around 1.1 billion people of the total global population , which is , among other factors , due to most of the inhabitants belonging to the low income group where children are needed to help provide for the family by starting to work at earlier ages .

As a result , 9 out of the top 10 countries with the highest fertility rates are in Africa , as can be seen above .
