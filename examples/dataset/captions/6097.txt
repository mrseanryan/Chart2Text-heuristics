In 2013 , it appears that the majority of French teenagers were in middle school when they had their first kiss . Love appears to be an important area of life at a young age , with more than 50 percent of young French people stating that love relationships were important for them . First love experiences Even though new technologies and smartphones may have changed the way teenagers live their love life , it seems that the age for first love and sex experiences has not really changed over the years . From 2014 to 2017 , the median age at first sexual intercourse remained at 17 years , regardless of gender . But before experiencing love with a partner , teenagers first discover their sexuality alone or through pornographic movies . Most teenagers were aged 13 to 14 years the first time they masturbated , whereas the majority of young French people were between 14 and 15 years old when they watched a porno movie for the first time . A change in sexual practices Easy access to porn from the Internet might has an influence on the way young adults see their sexuality . In 2017 , 18 percent of female teenagers in France thought that pornography had a rather negative impact on their sexuality . On the other hand , sexual liberation , as well as the influence of feminist rhetoric in society , might also impact the evolution of sexual practices . In 1992 , 42 percent of teenagers aged 18 to 19 years declared having already practiced oral sex . In 2013 , this share reached nearly 80 percent .
