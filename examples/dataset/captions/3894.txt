The statistic represents the biggest nuclear accidents worldwide from 1957 to 2011 , rated by INES scale . The nuclear accident that occurred in Fukushima in 2011 received a score of seven , and was thus rated as a major accident . Nuclear events and the INES scale â€“ additional information In 1990 , the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) introduced the International Nuclear Event Scale ( INES ) to act as a tool for prompt communication with the public in case of a nuclear event . Its intention is to act as a standard guideline that can bridge understanding for the safety significance of these events between the technical community , the public , and the media . In fact , the INES scale can be implemented in any event that is associated with the use , storage , and transport of radioactive materials and sources , including loss or theft , and the discovery of virgin materials . The INES scale is logarithmic , where each increasing level represents an accident that is ten times more severe than the previous rating . The disasters in Fukushima , Japan in 2011 and Chernobyl , Ukraine in 1986 received a 7 on the INES scale , the highest classification on the scale . Ratings between 4 and 7 are classified as accidents with 4 representing an accident with local consequences and a 7 representing a major accident . A major accident represents a major release of radioactive material , indicating widespread health and environmental impacts . A lethal dose of radioactive radiation among humans is 7,000 millisievert . Chernobyl reactors still emit radiation that has been measured at 6,000 millisievert . The UN estimates that the average individual receives an annual average dose of about 2.4 millisievert . After the Fukushima accident , an estimated 52 billion yen were paid to households that were victim to the event . Opposition for nuclear energy rose rapidly in Japan and South Korea after the event , reaching some 52 percent and 66 percent , respectively .
