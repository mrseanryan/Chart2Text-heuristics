Cotton production in the United States fluctuates significantly from year to year . In 2019 , around 20.1 million bales of cotton were produced in the United States , a drop from 18.4 million bales in the previous year . Leading States for cotton production Historically , much of the cotton in the United States has been grown in the Southern states , and this trend continues to this day . Texas had a cotton production volume of about 6.94 million bales in 2018 , making that state the top producer of cotton in the United States . Texas produced several times more than the second leading producer of cotton , Georgia . In that year , Georgia produced around 1.95 million bales of cotton . Genetically modified cotton Compared to other crops like genetically modified corn and soybeans , the acreage of genetically modified cotton is relatively low in the United States . However , between 2015 and 2017 the area planted with GM cotton in the U.S. has been creeping . One of the most common types of genetically modified cotton is herbicide resistant cotton , which can survive being sprayed with herbicides while surrounding weeds are destroyed
