Quality of products is always an important factor when it comes to consumption and spending , and many consumers define a certain product 's quality standard by applying specific characteristics - one of those being its origin . Nowadays , Germany is synonymous with high-quality cars , for example , while Switzerland would be known for high-quality clocks or chocolate , and Italy for fine wine . Quality measured In order to make these preferences among consumers visible , the global Made-In-Country Index was conducted - to show how positively products `` made in ... '' are perceived in various countries all over the world . The index is calculated based on each country 's average weighted share of positive perception . First rank is set as Index 100 . Quality perceived The `` Made in '' label was introduced in Great Britain in the 19th century to make distinguishing foreign products easier , since foreign manufacturers had taken to labelling their goods with false marks . Most of the products thusly labelled `` made in '' came from Germany , which is why the `` Made in Germany '' label gained publicity and became very well-known . While it was not necessarily a label of quality at the time , this perception has been reversed completely : `` Made in Germany '' is now one of the highest seals a product could receive .
