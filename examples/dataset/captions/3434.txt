This statistic shows the change in the price of automotive diesel per liter in selected countries for the period between December 2018 and December 2019 . The price changes exclude value added taxes from prices for automotive diesel . In December 2019 , the diesel price per liter in the United States was 2.2 seven percent lower than it was in December 2019 . Change in the price of automotive diesel There are many types of diesel , most commonly a fractional distillate of petroleum fuel oil , all of which are constantly being developed and adapted for the industry . As of 2006 , almost all of the petroleum-based diesel fuels in Europe and North America are an ultra-low sulfur diesel ( ULSD ) . Using ULSD will promote more strict emission technologies for diesel engines and lower-emission fuels . Diesel is used for vehicles with diesel engines . Unlike gas engines , diesel engines usually inject diesel directly into the cylinder to continue combustion and thus , move the piston . Due to high compression ratios , diesel engines are often more efficient than conventional gasoline engines . However , diesel can convert into a gel-like substance in colder temperatures , preventing movement through the fuel systems . Diesel has a higher volumetric energy density than conventional gasoline , which is important for fuel efficiency . During colder seasons , the price of diesel tends to rise as demand for heating oil also increases . From March 2015 to 2016 , many countries saw a decrease in the price of automotive diesel per liter such as the United States , United Kingdom , and Germany . In the U.S. , diesel cars only account for approximately three percent of the car market . In the United Kingdom , however , 42 percent of new cars registered in 2017 were diesel . In the European Union as a whole , some 44.8 percent of passenger cars were diesel as of 2017 .
