Compared to other European countries , Dutch consumers are less likely to buy online from foreign retailers . This might be caused by two reasons . First , the Bol.com brand ( as well as the supermarket brand Albert Heijn , which have the same owner ) is a household name in Dutch society and people are familiar with it . Another reason might be in the ease of use : like most Dutch online e-commerce retailers , Bol.com offers iDEAL ( which allows Dutch shoppers to use their bank debit cards for online purchases ) as a payment method .
