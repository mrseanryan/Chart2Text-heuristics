Light truck retail sales in the United States increased to 12.2 million units in 2019 , the highest level on record . This number has been increasing since 2010 , when the auto industry began recovering from low vehicle purchases during the 2008 - 2009 financial crisis . In 2018 , sales of light trucks accounted for about 72 percent of the approximately 17 million light vehicles sold in the United States . Ford , with its signature truck , the Ford F-150 , is the leading North American car brand in the United States . Why are consumers buying trucks now ? The U.S. economy has largely recovered from the woes of the financial crisis and unemployment rates fell to 3.7 percent in 2019 . This , coupled with a low unemployment rate , means that consumers are better able to purchase new vehicles . Similarly , due to lower gasoline and diesel fuel prices , motorists are more willing to buy trucks over smaller , more fuel-efficient sedans .
