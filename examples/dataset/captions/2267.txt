All other Asia Pacific countries seemed to pale in comparison . Why Asia Pacific ? Interestingly , China did not only produce the most passenger cars in the Asia Pacific region in 2018 , but it was estimated to produce the most passenger cars throughout the entire world in 2018 . It is also anticipated that Chinese manufacturing companies such as BYD Auto co. Ltd will overtake the likes of America-based manufacturer Tesla in the electric car segment . Manufacturer collaborations China has implemented a strong culture for joint ventures in the automotive industry . The leading car manufacturers worldwide , including General Motors , Nissan , Peugeot , and Volkswagen all have joint ventures with Chinese carmakers , including the Big Four Chinese auto manufacturers . SAIC Motor Corporation Limited ( informally SAIC , formerly Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation ) , Chang'an Automobile , FAW Group Corporation , and Dongfeng Motor Corporation are counted among China 's leading motor vehicle manufacturers . Its joint venture policy has helped China become Asia 's main producer of automobiles , ahead of Japan and South Korea . Unlike China , these two countries have had strong domestic automotive sectors of their own for many decades and are home to some of the most valuable automobile manufacturers worldwide , such as Toyota , Honda , and Hyundai .
