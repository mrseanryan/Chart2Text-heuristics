In total there are about 61 active dentists per every 100,000 people living in the United States , though there is significant variability in the number of dentists available depending on the state . As of 2017 , California , Texas and New York had the largest number of active dentists working . California was ranked first with over 30 thousand active dentists . Despite having the largest number of dentists working , these states were not always the states with the highest number of dentists per population . Dentistry within the U.S. â€“ a supply cliff ? Recent estimates have suggested that the dentistry workforce in the U.S. is lacking by over 10,000 dentists . However , some states host a much higher number of dentists per population . The top states for the number of active dentists per population includes the District of Columbia , Massachusetts and Alaska . Despite variability across the U.S. , attractive salaries may be one way to attract more dentists to practice . In a recent survey of dental professionals , dentists that worked in non-solo private practices had some of the highest annual incomes among all dentists . Dental access and use in the U.S . Dental use and access are staggeringly low in the United States . However , it is recommended that all people should visit their dentist regularly for cleaning and maintenance even if they have no dental issues . One barrier to dental care can be the high costs attached to some services and the lack of dental insurance to pay for care . While a majority of those that access dental services have some form of coverage to help them pay , a significant proportion of those accessing dental services are not covered by any type of insurance . Recommendations for increasing access to dental services include targeted public health programs , better insurance options and increasing the dental workforce within the U.S .
