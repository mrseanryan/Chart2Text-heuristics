How many pubs are there in the UK ? There were approximately 47,600 pubs operating in the United Kingdom in 2018 . This represented a decrease of approximately 7,200 pubs in the last ten years , and over 13,200 pubs since 2000 . Pubs in decline Several factors have been suggested for the decline in pubs in the UK . Public houses , once considered an important pillar of British communities , have faced several challenges related to changing consumer behavior . The 2007 indoor smoking ban and rising alcohol prices deterred people from drinking in pubs , sparking a trend in â€˜ pre-loading ' on cheap supermarket-bought alcohol before going out . Socializing at home has also become more common place thanks to developments in technology and home entertainment . Not to mention younger generations are drinking less , with more 16 - 24-year olds choosing to not drink alcohol at all . New trends continue to attract pub goers Although many businesses have succumbed to closure , the nation 's pub culture is still thriving , albeit in different ways . The popularity of pubs for eating out has resulted in many businesses increasing their food offering and taking advantage of new drinking trends such as craft and non-alcoholic beers . Independent pubs , although having a seemingly higher risk of closure , have in fact increased in number : there were around 4,550 more independently owned pubs in the UK in 2017 than ten years earlier . This may be due in part to the emergence of micro-breweries , and consumers becoming more sophisticated in their tastes , preferring to visit traditional pubs or other independents which cater to more sophisticated tastes than the larger pub chains . Independently owned pubs still make up the largest proportion of pubs in the UK , the rest being managed , tenanted or leased by a brewer or pub company .
