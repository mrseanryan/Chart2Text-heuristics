According to the most recent data , more people died in Spain than were born in 2018 , with figures reaching over 427 thousand deaths versus 370 thousand newborns . During the period under consideration , 2008 ranked as the year in which the largest number of children were born , with figures reaching over half million newborns . The depopulation of a country The population of Spain has been in decline for many years and was projected to decrease by nearly one million by 2023 . This will not come as a surprise since Spain has the lowest fertility rate in the European Union , with barely 1.34 children per woman according to the latest reports . During the last ten years , the country featured a continuous population density of approximately 93 inhabitants per square kilometer – a figure far from the European average , which stood nearly at nearly 121 inhabitants per square kilometer in 2017 . Migration inflow : an essential role in the Spanish population growth One of the key points to balance out this population downtrend in Spain is immigration – Spain 's immigration figures finally started to pick up in 2015 after a downward trend that presumably initiated after the 2008 financial crisis , which left Spain with one of the highest unemployment rates in Europe .
