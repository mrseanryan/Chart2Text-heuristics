The statistic shows the total population of India from 2014 to 2024 . In 2018 , the estimated total population in India amounted to approximately 1.33 billion people . Total population in India India currently has the second-largest population in the world and is projected to overtake top-ranking China within forty years . Its residents comprise more than one-seventh of the entire world 's population , and despite a slowly decreasing fertility rate ( which still exceeds the replacement rate and keeps the median age of the population relatively low ) , an increasing life expectancy adds to an expanding population . In comparison with other countries whose populations are decreasing , such as Japan , India has a relatively small share of aged population , which indicates the probability of lower death rates and higher retention of the existing population . With a land mass of less than half that of the United States and a population almost four times greater , India has recognized potential problems of its growing population . Government attempts to implement family planning programs have achieved varying degrees of success . Initiatives such as sterilization programs in the 1970s have been blamed for creating general antipathy to family planning , but the combined efforts of various family planning and contraception programs have helped halve fertility rates since the 1960s . The population growth rate has correspondingly shrunk as well , but has not yet reached less than one percent growth per year . As home to thousands of ethnic groups , hundreds of languages , and numerous religions , a cohesive and broadly-supported effort to reduce population growth is difficult to create . Despite that , India is one country to watch in coming years . It is also a growing economic power ; among other measures , its GDP per capita was expected to triple between 2003 and 2013 and was listed as the third-ranked country for its share of the global gross domestic product .
