How many goals were scored in the 2014 FIFA World Cup ? A total of 171 goals were scored across the 2014 FIFA World Cup held in Brazil . This marked a joint record for the tournament along with France 1998 . The goal-fest in 2014 was thanks to some unusually high-scoring games , including Netherlands beating Spain 5 - 1 in the group stages and , most famously , Germany embarrassing Brazil 7 - 1 at the semi-final stage . The 2014 World Cup in Brazil also holds the record for the most amount of different scorers in a single tournament with 121 players.Goals galore The highest ever goals to game ratio was during the 1954 World Cup in Switzerland , where an average of 5.38 goals were scored in each of the 26 games . Some of the highest scoring games during this tournament included Austria 7 Switzerland 5 and Hungary 9 South Korea 0 . The honor of the highest individual goalscorer of all time at World Cups belongs to Germany 's Miroslav Klose . The iconic striker scored a total of 16 goals across 4 World Cups , his 16th and record-breaking goal coming in Germany 's semi-final demolition of Brazil at the 2014 World Cup.Goal droughts At the other end of the scale , the Italy 1990 World Cup had the fewest average goals per match with the ball hitting the back of the net 115 times in 52 matches , thus averaging 2.21 goals per match . The fewest goals scored in a single tournament stands at 70 , which occurred at the first two World Cups in 1930 and 1934 . This can be explained by the fact that only 13 and 16 teams respectively took part in the finals and so fewer games were played overall . The format for the finals was changed for the 1982 World Cup in Spain in which 24 teams participated . The current format , first implemented in France 1998 , sees 32 teams split into eight groups of four .
