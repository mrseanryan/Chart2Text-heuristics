How many dogs are there in the US ? According to a pet owners survey , there were approximately 89.7 million dogs owned in the United States in 2017 . This is an increase of over 20 million since the beginning of the survey period in 2000 , when around 68 million dogs were owned in the United States . Why has this figure increased ? The resident population of the United States has also increased significantly within this time period . It is , therefore , no surprise that the number of dogs owned in U.S. households has also increased , especially when considering that the household penetration rate for dog-ownership reached almost 50 percent in recent years . The dog food market in the United States The large number of dogs owned by Americans creates a lucrative market for pet food brands and retailers . Pedigree , the leading dry dog food name brand in the U.S. , had sales amounting to around 550 million U.S. dollars in 2017 . Pedigree also led the pack in the wet dog food category , with sales of around 240 million U.S. dollars in the same year .
