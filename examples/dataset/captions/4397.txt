In 2016 , the Ligue 1 TV broadcasting rights revenue amounted to 748 million euros . The broadcasting of football events is the live coverage of football matches on television or radio . In recent years , the global value of the French top football league is increasing , whether it concerns the market value of the teams or the transfer fee spending of Ligue 1 football clubs . An increase of TV broadcasting rights revenue It seems that the broadcasting rights revenue of the French Ligue 1 has been increasing since the beginning of the 2000s . In 2001 , TV broadcasting rights for the French football league reached 275 million euros , compared to 748 million euros in 2016 . For the 2017 - 2018 season , Paris Saint-Germain was the French football club which had the highest revenue collected from television rights , in front of Marseille and Olympique Lyonnais . The club 's presence in the Champions League and its world-renowned players probably explain this position in the rankling . However , in comparison with the others big five European football leagues , the broadcasting rights of the Ligue 1 do not appear to be particularly high . In 2016 , the broadcasting rights revenue of the Premier League , the top-level English football league , amounted to 3.2 billion euros , while the total revenue of the broadcasting rights of the Spanish Liga reached more than 1.4 billion euros . A new interest for the Ligue 1 ? Since the recent arrival of foreign investors in French football , the Ligue 1 is attracting more interest . With players like Neymar or Mbapp√© , Paris Saint-Germain has become a club followed throughout Europe despite its results in the Champions League . In 2017 , the transfer fee spending of Ligue 1 football clubs reached a record number of 1.1 billion euros , compared to 283 million euros the year before . Even though the league 's revenue is still the lowest of the so-called `` Big Five '' European football leagues , Ligue 1 has a market value which is increasing since 2010 .
