Sexual assault in Alaska Fighting sexual assault in Alaska is particularly difficult due to small , isolated , close-knit communities who can be wary of airing their dirty laundry to outsiders , as well as a low number of law enforcement employees in the state . In addition , Alaska 's low population is spread out over a large land area , meaning that in the event of an assault being reported to police , it can take law enforcement hours , or even days , to reach the most isolated communities .
