The statistic shows the member states of the European Union with the highest number cashless payment transactions in 2018 . In the United Kingdom ( UK ) , approximately 27.7 billion transactions were reported from the cashless payment segment , making the UK Europe 's leading member state in terms of cashless payment transactions . The dawn of cashless payments The practice of paying without cash has its roots in the United States and was first used in the 1940s as a means of paying for automobile fuel . As the number of motorists in the country that would soon become the world 's dominant economy began to rise , a way was sought to make the process of re-fueling more convenient . This was the dawn of the cashless payment . The process is so popular now , that in 2018 more than 111 billion cashless transactions took place in the EU member states . Cashless payment transactions It took a while before the practice was to be adopted in other parts of the world . Initial adoption rates of one form of cashless payment , the credit card , were high in the United States , Canada and the United Kingdom but elsewhere the acceptance levels were relatively slow . It took until the mid 1990s for the credit card payments to be more widely accepted , but despite this , usage rates around the world vary vastly . Some countries are very cash oriented and despite Germany 's position as the country with the third highest number of cashless payment transactions in Europe , the country is generally considered to be primarily cash-reliant . Cultural aspects might have a role to play into that : debt and financial insecurity is identified as a highly negative value in the culture . The fear of ‘ Schuld ' _ , which translates as well into ‘ guilt ' and ‘ blame ' as it does into ‘ debt ' _ , stands as one of the possible reasons to explain as to why it is more common to pay with cash in Germany .
