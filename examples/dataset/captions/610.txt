Nigeria 's inflation has been higher than the average for African and Sub-Saharan countries for years now , and even exceeded 16 percent in 2017 – and a real , significant decrease is nowhere in sight . The bigger problem is its unsteadiness , however : An inflation rate that is bouncing all over the place , like this one , is usually a sign of a struggling economy , causing prices to fluctuate , and unemployment and poverty to increase . Nigeria 's economy - a so-called `` mixed economy '' , which means the market economy is at least in part regulated by the state – is not entirely in bad shape , though . More than half of its GDP is generated by the services sector , namely telecommunications and finances , and the country derives a significant share of its state revenues from oil . Because it got high To simplify : When the inflation rate rises , so do prices , and consequently banks raise their interest rates as well to cope and maintain their profit margin . Higher interest rates often cause unemployment to rise . In certain scenarios , rising prices can also mean more panicky spending and consumption among end users , causing debt and poverty . The extreme version of this is called hyperinflation : A rapid increase of prices that is out of control and leads to bankruptcies en masse , devaluation of money and subsequently a currency reform , among other things . But does that mean that low inflation is better ? Maybe , but only to a certain degree ; the ECB , for example , aspires to maintain an inflation rate of about two percent so as to keep the economy stable . As soon as we reach deflation territory , however , things are starting to look grim again . The best course is a stable inflation rate , to avoid uncertainty and rash actions . Nigeria today Nigeria is one of the countries with the largest populations worldwide and also the largest economy in Africa , with its economy growing rapidly after a slump in the aforementioned year 2017 . It is slated to be one of the countries with the highest economic growth over the next few decades . Demographic key indicators , like infant mortality rate , fertility rate , and the median age of the population , all point towards a bright future . Additionally , the country seems to make big leaps forward in manufacturing and technological developments , and boasts huge natural resources , including natural gas . All in all , Nigeria and its inflation seem to be on the upswing – or on the path to stabilization , as it were .
