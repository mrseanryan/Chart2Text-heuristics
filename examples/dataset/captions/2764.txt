At 30 aircraft orders , Emirates was Boeing 's largest customer in 2019 . In November 2019 , the airline updated its order book , made some contractual changes , and placed an order for 30 Dreamliners . Boeing reported 246 gross orders in 2019 . Boeing in the international market Boeing and its main competitor Airbus dominate the global aircraft manufacturing market . Boeing is headquartered in the United States , and Airbus in the Netherlands , although the company 's main offices are located in France and Spain . Boeing and Airbus are the aircraft manufacturers with the highest revenue globally . At the moment these two companies arguably constitute a duopoly . What is a duopoly ? A duopoly is a market with only two firms . The lack of competition means that the firms can set prices based on the response of the other , which is higher than the consumers would prefer . The case of Boeing and Airbus is not a perfect duopoly because of the existence of other companies , but these companies have very low market share . However , aviation depends largely on technology . Any company that gets an edge in research and development has a distinct advantage in the growing world market , which means that the standard duopoly model may not fully apply here .
