Between January 2019 and January 2020 , food prices in the United Kingdom increased by 1.4 percent . A period of continuous deflation between March 2015 and January 2017 preceded a return to a sustained rise of the cost of food from February 2017 onwards . Inflation rate and consumer price index Inflation is commonly measured via the consumer price index , which illustrates changes to prices paid by consumers for a representative basket of goods and services . An annualized percentage change in the price index constitutes a measure of inflation . In order to maintain an inflation rate at a stable level , to enable the general public and businesses to plan their spending , the Government set a two percent inflation target for the Bank of England . European post-referendum comparison Recent increases of food prices were linked to severe weather in 2018 as well as the risk of a no-deal Brexit . In the wake of the referendum held on June 23 , 2016 , when the majority supported the withdrawal from the European Union ( EU ) , trends with respect to food prices remained analogous in the EU as well as the UK . However , in 2019 the UK is forecast to exhibit a higher CPI inflation rate than Germany and France , the other two largest countries in terms of nominal gross domestic product .
