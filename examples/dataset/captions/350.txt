National debt in the EU member states National or government debt is the debt owed by a central government . No country in the European Union is debt-free , although some are able to manage their debts better than others . Debt is influenced by the economic situation of a country , factors such as unemployment , the rate of inflation or the trade figures have a significant impact on its extent , and are , in turn , influenced by the national debt . The economic crisis has hit some EU countries harder than others ; Spain , Ireland and Greece especially have been struggling economically since 2008 . Greece 's national debt has skyrocketed over the past few years , and the same can be said about Spain and Ireland . Other EU countries , like France and the United Kingdom have been affected as well , albeit not as severely . The national debt of a country can be reduced by applying several measures : money can be borrowed ( for example in the form of rescue packages ) , austerity programs can be enforced , taxes can be increased or central banks can inject liquidity into the economy through the implementation of quantitative easing policies . Some critics of the policy claim that this could lead to a higher level of inflation , which , if severe enough , could have a detrimental impact on living standards .
