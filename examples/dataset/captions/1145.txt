In 2019 , around 18.27 billion gallons of fuel were consumed by U.S. airlines , compared to a high of 18.43 billion gallons in 2007 . While the consumption of airline fuel in the United States has increased in recent years , it is yet to surpass the levels seen prior to the 2008 recession . Commercial airlines The above figures include all commercial air carriers based in the U.S. who carry cargo and/or passengers on domestic or international flights , and with annual revenue of over 20 million U.S. dollars . Excluded is airline fuel used for military or private flights . Given that the U.S. has the largest business and military aircraft fleets in the world , if included the figures would be appreciably higher . Overall growth in commercial aviation Given the commercial aviation market in the U.S. has experienced strong growth since 2009 , with revenue figures and passenger traffic well above pre-recession levels , the fact that fuel consumption is currently lower than in 2007 may appear curious . The likely explanation is that the cost of airline fuel reached record levels around 2012 , forcing airlines to find ways to decrease fuel consumption wherever possible .
