This statistic shows the degree of urbanization in Romania from 2008 to 2018 . Urbanization means the share of urban population in the total population of a country . In 2018 , 54 percent of Romania 's total population lived in urban areas and cities . The shrinking population of Romania About half of Romania 's population lives in urban areas , with the largest city and capital Bucharest only having about 1.9 million inhabitants - not very much considering that Romania reported a population of about 20 million people in 2015 . Bucharest is also significantly larger than any of the other small cities around the country , which only have close to or less than 300,000 inhabitants each . The fact that Romania has not urbanized to the same level of most developed countries is an indicator that the country is still developing . As Romania progresses , it has an important advantage over other developing nations : It is a member of the European Union , and thus has access to the European market . However , unlike other developing countries , the Romanian population is decreasing and expected to shrink by more than half a million by 2020 . This is caused by a low fertility rate , which is less than the replacement rate , by emigration and by an aging population . The median age of the Romanian population is expected to increase to as high as 44 years in 2020 . A contributing factor to this may be the fact that while the older generation stays in Romania , the younger people migrate to other countries within the European Union which have stronger economies and more employment opportunities than Romania .
