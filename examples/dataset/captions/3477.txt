This statistic shows the results of a survey on tattoos . The respondents were sorted by their occupation . 14 percent of respondents working in retail admitted having a tattoo . Tattoos and body art For centuries , tattoos have been used in many cultures as a form of body modification . They were used as a way of identifying oneself and others , as a talisman against evil spirits , rites of passage or for social reasons . Since tattooing was and still is popular all over the world , there are several different kinds of tattoo art . The style of Japanese tattoo art , for example , is distinctively different from that of gang members in the United States . After a period of being regarded as an indicator for deviant behavior , tattoos have gained acceptance in Western society and are mostly considered a way of expressing oneself , not a sign of moral deviance . The number of Americans with a tattoo has risen significantly during the last decade ; they are especially popular among the 25 to 39 year-olds . Still , the overwhelming majority of Americans prefer tattoos which are not visible when they are fully clothed , probably because tattoos are still seen as a hindrance to finding a job , despite growing social acceptance . Among office job workers , tattoos are significantly less accepted than in fields which do not require customer contact or representation , as can be seen above . Interestingly enough , piercings , another form of body modification , are considered even worse than visible tattoos when it comes to employment . A slight majority of tattooed Americans make sure their body art is not visible when they are at their workplace .
