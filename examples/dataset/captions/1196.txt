In the United States , more than half of the population reported owning a pet in 2011 . This number has been quite steady since then . Today there are more than 90 million cats in the United States , while the number of dogs is just below the 90 million-mark . Freshwater fish are the most common pet with almost 140 million nationwide in 2018 , followed by the aforementioned cats and dogs . Pet expenses When it comes to expenses , fish are generally considered low maintenance compared to other pets . Dogs especially require high expense , particularly for kennel boarding while their owners are away . However , the highest costs for dog owners are due to surgical vet visits , reported at almost double the expense for cats in 2019 . Lower life expectancy could be a factor - around 11 years for a medium-sized dog , compared with 12 to 15 years for cats . Pet food Food is currently the largest expense for cat owners , and the second highest for dogs , not even including treats . Despite the convenience of buying pet food online , or while already grocery shopping in a supermarket , food store , or wholesale club , the highest share of pet food sales comes from pet specialty chains . With many owners are willing to make the extra trip for their pets , chain shops Pet Smart and PetCo make up almost half the market for pet companies in the United States .
