Deutsche Bank 's tier 1 capital ratio sank to 14.9 percent in 2018 , down from 16.8 percent the year before . Still , this is two percentage points higher than the years after the 2008 Financial Crisis . What is tier 1 capital ? Tier 1 capital is money that a bank must keep on hand , here expressed as a percentage of overall assets . This ratio is important because banks do not hold their total assets in their vault . Instead , they issue loans for which they can charge interest . The capital that they keep on hand is a buffer to ensure that they can cover any demands for withdrawals . Preventing a bank run If a large share of depositors request money at the same time , the bank may have trouble repaying them all immediately . This is called a bank run and can lead to bank failures , like those in 1930 and 1931 . Fortunately , Deutsche Bank can rely on the European Central Bank 's marginal lending facility for overnight loans in case of a run on deposits . However , with a robust tier 1 capital ratio , the need for overnight loans should be minimal .
