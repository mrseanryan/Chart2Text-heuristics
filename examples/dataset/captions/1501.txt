The Indian sports industry has grown dramatically over the last few years . The industry became one of the fastest growing with a margin of around ten percent over the global average . The total revenue of the industry was projected to be around 1.9 million U.S. dollars in 2015 . The Indian Premier League , Hockey India League , Indian Badminton League , Pro Kabbadi and the Indian Sports League are some of the initiatives giving a major boost to the industry and also encouraging the younger generations to take up other sports in a country where cricket has dominated the sports culture since the British rule . Media is popularity Media investments continue to be an essential part of the industry via broadcast and advertising to reach TV households . Hindi seemed to be the preferred choice when it comes to watching sports . Cricket dominated the on-ground sponsorship among sports , but the nation has re-discovered its love for kabaddi , a game originating within the country , which has already overtaken football in terms of popularity and sponsorship . Cricketers , however , are still the best-paid sportspeople . The bigger picture 2019 was a successful year for Indian sports not just limited to the mainstream . Ace badminton player PV Sindhu won the gold at the World Championship . The shooting team finished with five gold medals in Rio , and the country lead the ISSF Senior World Cup events with 16 gold medals . The general audience in India , had seemed to make the shift from just daily soaps as a source of entertainment to the domestic sports industry , giving a much-needed boost to the latter in the global market .
