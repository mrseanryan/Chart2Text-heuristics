The statistic portrays the world 's strongest earthquakes , as of 2020 . A magnitude of 9.0 was measured on the Richter scale during the earthquake in Japan in 2011 . Earthquakes and the Richter scale â€“ additional informationAn earthquake occurs when two tectonic plates under the Earth 's surface slip past one another , resulting in the sudden release of energy in the Earth 's crust . The sudden violent shaking of the surface can cause destruction to infrastructure , human injury , and even death . The earthquake that occurred on January 17 , 1994 in Los Angeles caused damages that were valued up to 30 billion U.S. dollars . As earthquakes are the result of plate boundary interactions , earthquakes tend to occur in a few specific areas , localized around hotspots . China was one of the most frequently affected countries , with more than 150 earthquakes between 1900 and 2016 . Although , earthquakes can be difficult to predict , Earthquake Early Warning systems , which use seismic networks for detection , are put in place to protect peoples ' lives . There are also a number of ways to measure the magnitude of an earthquake . One of the first and most widely-used methods is the Richter scale . The Richter magnitude scale was developed by the seismologist , Charles F. Richter , in 1935 . On the Richter Scale , magnitude is expressed in whole numbers and decimal fractions , but is based on a logarithmic scale . For example , a magnitude 5.3 might be computed for a moderate earthquake , and a strong earthquake might be rated as magnitude 6.3 . The 1960 earthquake that occurred in Chile was the strongest earthquake recorded between 1900 and 2020 , which was measured at a 9.5 magnitude based on the Richter scale . An earthquake with a magnitude of 9.0 and higher is defined as causing near or at total destruction - severe damage or collapse to all buildings .
