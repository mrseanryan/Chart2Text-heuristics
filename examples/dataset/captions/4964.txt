Based on a ranking on the prize money earned by the leading eSporters in Fortnite from the Netherlands , 21-year-old Rojo ( the gamer tag of Dave Jong ) outperformed all other eSporters . This because of his second place on the Fortnite World Cup in July 2019 , which won him one million U.S. dollars . Most of the popularity of the Battle Royale game stems from online game streams . In 2017 , 36 percent of Dutch game stream watchers used Twitch . Is Fortnite big in Dutch eSports ? Over the whole of 2018 , Fortnite players as Dmitri `` Mitr0 '' van de Vrie , Sven `` Svennos '' Edelenbosch and Milan `` Milan '' Lopes also topped the overall prize money ranking for Dutch eSporters . There was no entry for Dave `` Rojo '' Jong then , as the player was not yet involved in competitive play . During this time , the video game rapidly grew in popularity in the Netherlands as can be seen in the net revenue reached by its mobile version in 2018 and 2019 . How about Fornite 's competitors in the Netherlands ? Fortnite and PlayerUnknown 's Battlegrounds or PUBG received much global media attention in 2018 due to their high popularity . Both games were the first Battle Royale games , a genre of video games where up to 100 players are pitted against each other in a fight for survival until only one player is left standing . In 2019 , Apex Legends joined these two as a Battle Royale only game ( other video game series implemented a Battle Royale mode ) . For the latter , no data is available yet in the Netherlands . For PUBG , it seems that only a few Dutch eSporters were active in this game . This might have to do with both Fortnite 's free-to-play model ( players pay for cosmetics , but the game itself is free ) as well as the more competitive nature of PUBG .
